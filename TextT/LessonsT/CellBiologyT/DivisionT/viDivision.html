        <p><h3><b>Cell Division</b></h3><br>
            <b>Cell Cycle</b><br>
            	Cells that are progressing through the cell cycle are proliferating, either for tissue growth, regeneration or gametogenesis.<br>
            	Mitosis is the period when somatic cells divide.<br>
                The most important outcome of mitosis is equal partitioning of replicated genomes.<br>
                Interphase constitutes the vast majority of the cell cycle.   For the typical human cell mitosis takes less than a day, while interphase can last days to years.<br>
                Interphase is divided into three periods, Gap1 (G1), S phase and G2.<br>
                S phase is the period when DNA replication occurs. It commences with the onset of replication, and ends with the completion of replication.<br>
                S stands for synthesis of DNA.<br>
                The gaps are periods without DNA replication. G1 and G2 occur before and after S phase respectively.<br>
                They are not periods of decreased activity.  Energy expenditure, metabolism  and gene expression all occur at comparable levels to S phase.<br>
                During G1 the machinery required for DNA replication is synthesized. This machinery includes G1 cyclins and DNA polymerase.<br>
                G2 is the period when the cell prepares for mitosis.  This involves G2 cyclin synthesis.<br>
                Cells that stop dividing go from G1 to G0.<br>
                Cells in G0 do not progress to S phase.<br>
                G0 can last a lifetime.<br>
                Most of the cells in the adult body do not divide and are in a continuous G0 stage.<br>
            <b>Glossary for Cell Division/b><br>
            	Mitosis - Somatic cell division, separating replicated genomes.<br>
                Mitosis produces two identical, diploid daughter cells.<br>
                Meiosis - Germline division, dividing genomes in half<br>
                Meiosis divides genomes in half, producing haploid gametes.<br>
                Gametes - Eggs and sperm<br>
                Germline - Gametes and gametic stem cells<br>
                The germline is a population of cells that pass on genetic material onto progeny. These include diploid stem cells that divide and differentiate into gametes, as well as the gametes themselves (presented in greater detail by Gametogenesis lesson).<br>
                Somatic - Everything except the germ line<br>
                Most of the reproductive system consists of somatic cells; not germline.  For instance, Sertoli and follicular cells of testes and ovaries are somatic, even though they are part of the reproductive system.<br>
                Note, this is the genetic and embryonic use of the word "somatic."  It is different from the anatomic definition (distal structures).<br>
                Homologs or Homologous Chromosomes, matching chromosomes from different parents<br>
                Chromatids, Replicated homologs<br>
                Sister Chromatids (dyad) – matching chromatids held together at centromeres.<br>
                Seen in mitosis<br>
                Tetrad (bivalent) - All 4 chromatids tied together <br>
                Occurs in meiosis<br>
                Note, throughout most of prophase I the four strands of a tetrad cannot be seen by light microscopy, because they are tied together so closely they look like a single strand.<br>
                During diakinesis, the last stage of prophase I, the chromatids separate. By the end of diakinesis, they are only held together at their centromeres.<br>
                Synapsis - The process of tying the tetrad chromatids together<br>
                Chiasmata (chiasma singular) - X shaped junctions that form where chromatids are tied together.<br>
                A chiasma consists of DNA and associate proteins that tie the strands together.<br>
                Synaptonemal Complexes - Proteinaceous complexes that mediate crossing over.<br>
                Crossing Over - Exchange of homologs<br>
                The purpose for synapsis is to facilitate crossing over.<br>
                Crossing over will be described in more detail, later in this lesson.<br>
                Ploidy - Number of sets of homologs <br>
                Haploid - One set of homologs<br>
                Diploid - Two sets of homologs<br>
                Ploidy refers to the number of sets of homologs that a cell possesses.  We inherit a set from each parent, so we are diploid.  Our gametes are haploid because meiosis reduces the homologous  sets from two to one.<br>
                Karyotypes demonstrate the two sets of homologs in a diploid genome.<br>
                n – numeric designation of ploidy<br>
                1 n, gametes<br>
                2 n, somatic tissues<br>
                Ploidy is designated by the n number. Haploid cells with one set of homologs are 1n.  Diploid cells with two sets of homologs are 2n.<br>
                C (DNA Content) - Mass of a homologous set<br>
                Do not confuse homologous sets (n) and the total number of chromatids, which can be quantified by C, the mass of a homologous set.<br>
                At the onset of S phase C and n both equal 2.  The diploid cell has two sets (2n), so its DNA mass is 2C.<br>
                By the end of S phase every chromatid has been replicated into two chromatids, so the total mass has doubled, 4C.<br>
                However, each of these replicated chromatids are identical; they are just two copies of the same homolog. Because no new genes are added, the ploidy is still 2n.<br>
                By the end of mitosis, the chromatids all segregate to different daughter cells, so each daughter returns to 2C.<br>
            <b>Mitosis, Somatic Cell Division</b><br>
            	Mitosis - Somatic cell division<br>
                The following lesson will focus on a single cell progressing through each phase.<br>
                See Cytoskeleton Lesson for Molecular Presentation of Mitotic Events. <br>
                Mitotic Overview<br>
                Periods, interphase, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, daughter cells<br>
                Cells are prepared for mitosis during interphase. The genomes are replicated during S phase. These genomes will be equally segregated between daughter cells during mitosis.<br>
                Interphase is the longest period of the cell cycle.  Metabolism, cell growth, centrosome duplication, DNA replication and gene expression, all occur during this stage.<br>
                Prophase marks the onset of mitosis.<br>
                Events of Prophase, Chromosome Condensation, Nuclear Envelope Dissociation, Centrosomes Separation, Mitotic Spindle Formation<br>
                Spindle formation occurs in cytoplasm.<br>
                Components of mitotic, and meiotic, spindles.<br>
                Asters, arrays of aster microtubules that radiate out from the centrosome at each pole of the spindle.<br>
                Polar microtubule, extends from an aster to the middle of the spindle, where they meet another polar microtubule extending from the aster at the opposite pole.<br>
                Kinetochore microtubules, extend from each aster to bind a pair of sister chromatids, in the middle of the spindle.<br>
                Kinetochore, proteinaceous complex links the centromeres of sister chromatids to the kinetochore microtubules.<br>
                By late prophase the condensing sister chromatids become visible by light microscopy.<br>
                Metaphase is when all sister chromatids attach to the mitotic spindle.<br>
                The metaphase plane is the hypothetical field where centromeres attach to the spindle.<br>
                This metaphase plate is a region of the metaphase plane.  The plate is positioned half way between the spindle poles.<br>
                Sister chromatids do not attach in a line along the metaphase plane. Instead, they attach in the circular metaphase plate.<br>
                Anaphase is the period when the chromatids are separated and drawn to the opposite poles of the spindle.<br>
                Alignment of sister chromatids during metaphase, and chromatid separation during anaphase, ensures that each daughter cell will inherit a complete diploid genome.<br>
                Telophase commences when all the chromatids reach their pole.  The first three events of telophase are a reversal of prophase.<br>
                Events of Telophase, Chromosomes Decondensation, Nuclear Envelope Reassociation, Mitotic Spindle Dissociation<br>
                Proliferating cells proceed through the cell cycle, replicating their genomes during S phase and precisely partitioning the replicates to each daughter by mitosis.<br>  
                Karyokinesis is division of the nucleus; <br>
                Karyokinesis is an intricate process, precisely ensuring that each daughter cell receives one copy of every chromatid in the diploid genome. <br> 
                Cytokinesis is division of the cytoplasm.<br>
                Officially cytokinesis is not a component of telophase, but it does occur during telophase.<br>
                With animals, cytokinesis is achieved by the cell constricting in two.  With plants a cell wall forms between daughter nuclei to partition the cytoplasm.<br>
                Equivalent segregation does not occur with cytokinesis.<br>
                The reason cytokinesis is not equivalent can best be explained by example.  It does not matter if one daughter cell inherits less PEPCK enzyme, or the other receives fewer ribosomes.  As long as each daughter inherits a complete genome, gene expression will correct any cytoplasmic deficits.<br>
                Mitosis is completed when the plasma membranes separate.  Each daughter cell then enters its next interphase.<br>
                Proliferating cells proceed through the cell cycle, replicating their genomes during S phase and precisely partitioning the replicates to each daughter by mitosis.<br>  
            <b>Meiosis, Gametic Cell Division</b><br>
                Two successive divisions reduce the genome of germline cells from diploid (2n) to haploid (1n).<br>
                Periods of meiosis<br>
                Gametic Stem Cells, Spermatogonia or Oogonia, Diploid<br>
                1st Meiotic Division, 2 n 4 c <br>
                Prophase I, Prophase I, Anaphase I, Anaphase I, Telophase I<br>
                Interphase<br>
                2nd Meiotic, Division, 2 n 2 c <br>
                Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II, Telophase II<br>
                Gametes, Haploid, 1n, 1c<br>
                Periods of Prophase I<br>
                Interphase, Leptotene, Sister Chromatids Begin to Condense, Zygotene, Homologs "Zipper Up", Pachytene, Crossing Over, Diplotene, Homologs Repel, Revealing Chiasmata, Diakinesis, Chiasmata Released.<br>
                Independent assortment is produced by crossing over, which occurs in prophase I of meiosis.  <br>
                Now we’ll focus on a single germ cell as it progresses through meiosis.  <br>
                Meiosis begins with a diploid Gametic Stem Cell<br>
                Leptotene is the early period when prophase I commences.<br>
                Chromosome Condensation begins during this period.<br>
                Zygotene is marked by synapsis, where homologs are bond into tetrads.<br>
                Pachytene is the period when crossing over occurs.<br>
                Crossing over will now be explained.<br>
                Synaptonemal complexes are ribbon-like structures that run down tetrads.<br>
                Synaptonemal complexes intermittently catalyze crossing over between adjacent homologs.<br>
                Thus, crossing over randomly shuffles genes, producing strands that are composites of the parental homologs. <br>
                Diplotene is marked by repulsion between the strands.<br>
                Chiasmata are where strands are held together.<br>
                By diakinesis the chiasmata all run off the ends of the tetrads.<br>
                Assembly of the meiotic spindle and nuclear envelope dissociation both commence during this period.<br>
                The rest of meiosis I and II mimic mitosis.  Each follows the same basic steps.<br>
                Metaphase I is like mitotic metaphase except that tetrads are tied to the spindle, not just  sister chromatids.<br>
                During anaphase II, tetrads are split into sister chromatids.<br>
                Meiotic interphase occurs between meiosis I & II. There is no S phase because the DNA is not replicated, but the centrosomes duplicate.<br>
                Meiotic interphase occurs between meiosis I & II. There is no S phase because the DNA is not replicated, but the centrosomes duplicate.<br>
                Gametes are the product of meiosis.  They have haploid, 1n genomes, with chromatids that are random composites of the parental homologs<br>
