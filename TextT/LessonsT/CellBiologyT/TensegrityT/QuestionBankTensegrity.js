        "a": "the knee bone is connected to the foot bone, foot bone connected to ankle bone, ankle bone to leg bone, leg to knee bone, knee to thigh bone, to hip bone, to back bone, neck bone, head bone, hand, arm, shoulder, back, dem noisy dry bones",
        "b": "relay race team",
        "c": "Charles III, Elizabeth II, George VI, Edward VIII, George V, Edward VII, Victoria, William IV, George IV, III, II, I, Anne, Mary & William, James II, Charles II, I, James I, Elizabeth I, Bloody Mary, Jane Grey, Edward VI, Henry VIII, VII, Richard III, Edward V, IV, Henry VI, Edward IV, Henry VI, V, IV, Richard II, Edward III, II, I, Henry III, John, Richard Lionheart, Henry II, Empress Matilda, Stephen, Henry I, William II, William the Conqueror, Edgar Ætheling, Harold Godwinson, Edward the Confessor, Harthacnut, Harold Harefoot, Cnut, Edmund Ironside, Æthelred Unready, Sweyn, Æthelred Unready, Edward the Martyr, Edgar the Peaceful, Eadwig, Eadred, Edmund Magnificent, Æthelstan",
        "d": "folks working together",
        "e": "bunch of stuff working together"

    "correctAns": [
        "e"

    "explain": {
        "a": "This nursery rhyme depicts the structural interconnection of the skeleton, but it doesn’t define functional interactions between the bones.",
        "b": "Teammates interact with other to compete in a relay race, but there is no structural interconnection between them.",
        "c": "This is the line of English monarchs.  They constitute a system, i.e. the successive rule of the country.  However, there is no structural interconnection between them.  Moreover, many did not cooperate.",
        "d": "People who work together constitutes a functional unit interacting to achieve a goal, but there is no structural interconnection between them.",
        "e": "CORRECT: Although this is a simplistic description, it does define structural and functional interactions which are the hallmark of tensegrity systems, i.e. a system of structural components interacting as a functional unit to achieve purpose."

    "question": "A patient’s left leg is shorter than his right.  The patient suffers from sore neck muscles.  How can this be explained? ",
    "Image": "",
    "answers": {
        "a": "the congenital anomaly that produced a short leg also affected the neck",
        "b": "the patient must be tense due to embarrassment of his legs",
        "c": "the patient must have wrenched is neck when he stumbled",
        "d": "the misalignment is transduced through the skeletomuscular system to his neck muscles",
        "e": "the symptoms cannot be related; a malformation of a lower limb could not affect the neck"

    "correctAns": [
        "d"

    "explain": {
        "a": "Although this is a possibility, there are no grounds for assuming that it has occurred.",
        "b": "Although this is a possibility, short leg syndrome is usually so indistinct that few people notice it, including patients with the condition.",
        "c": "Although this is a possibility, there are no grounds for assuming that it occurred.",
        "d": "CORRECT: One part of the skeletomuscular system can be transduced to another part because it is an interconnected, interacting tensegrity system.",
        "e": "Due to tensegrity, imbalance in one part of the skeletomuscular can affect another part."

    "question": "A common phenomenon of science fiction is for a person’s body to explode when exposed to the vacuum of space.  However, this is a fallacy.  Why can’t it occur?",

    "answers": {
        "a": "lungs would empty, releasing their internal pressure",
        "b": "the body would freeze",
        "c": "the skeleton would hold the body together",
        "d": "there is not enough internal pressure in the human body",

    "correctAns": [
        "e"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "The victim’s lung would empty, but this would not affect blood or tissue pressure.",
        "b": "Assuming the victim isn’t exposed to solar radiation then their body would freeze.  However, if the body could explode it would be virtually instantaneous so freezing would not occur fast enough.",
        "c": "Bones might remain intact, but this would not eliminate blood or tissue pressure.",
        "d": "The differential in pressure betweeen the victim’s body and zero pressure of a vacuum would be enough for explosion.",
        "e": "CORRECT: Although aberrations would occur such as embolisms and hemorrhaging, the body would not explode because the tissues are held together by cytoskeletons that are interconnected with adjacent cells and the extracellular matrix through intercellular junctions."
