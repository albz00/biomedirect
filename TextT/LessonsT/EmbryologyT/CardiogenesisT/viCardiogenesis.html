        <p><h3>Cardiogenesis</h3><br>
            <b>Cardiogenic Field</b><br>
            	Cardiac precursor cells are specified during primitive streak gastrulation.<br>
            	The first mesodermal cells to invaginate through the primitive streak at the caudal end of the bilaminar germ disc, get pushed to the cranial end of the trilaminar disc, where they constitute the horseshoe shaped region known as the cardiogenic field.<br>
            <b>Heart Tube</b><br>
            	The cardiogenic field assembles into a cylindrical structure known as the heart tube within the pericardial cavity.<br>
            <b>Blood Vessel Proliferation</b><br>
           	    Blood Vessels form by vasculogenesis throughout the embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderms.<br>
                Vasculogenesis is differentiation of clusters stem cells into blood vessels.<br>
            	After the vessels form, the circulatory system expands by angiogenesis, which is extension and branching of preexisting vessels.<br>
            <b>Heart Loop</b><br>
            	The heart tube is divided into 5 regions.  Listed from cranial to caudal, these regions are known as the aortic sac, truncus arteriosus, conus cordis, atrium & ventricle.<br>
                The heart tube twists to form the heart loop.<br>
            <b>Primitive Chambers</b><br>
            	Looping segregates the primitive heart into two chambers, one ventricle and one atrium.  These are connected by the atrioventricular canal.<br>
            <b>Pharyngeal Arteries</b><br>
            	At the two chambered stage there are two dorsal aortae.<br>
            	Five pairs of pharyngeal arteries extend to connect the aortic sac and aortae.<br>
            	The first and second pairs of pharyngeal arteries will regress, while the others contribute to the great arteries.<br>
            <b>Aortic Trunk</b><br>
            	The aortic trunk develops by fusion of the left embryonic aorta, forth pharyngeal artery, and right side of the aortic sac.<br>
            <b>Subclavian Artery</b><br>
            	The brachiocephalic & right subclavian arteries develop by fusion of a segment of the right embryonic aorta, forth pharyngeal artery, and a branch of the aortic sac.<br>
            	A peripheral artery known as the seventh intersegmental artery joins the right aorta to complete the right subclavian.<br>
            <b>Carotids</b><br>
            	The carotid arteries develop by fusion of the cranial ends of the embryonic aortae, and the third pharyngeal artery.<br>
            	External carotids branch off the 3rd pharyngeal arteries.<br>
            	The regions beyond these branches become the internal carotid arteries.<br>
            	The regions below these branches constitute the common carotids.<br>
            <b>Pulmonary Branch</b><br>
            	The pulmonary arteries and ductus arteriosus develop by fusion of the left side of the aortic sac and the sixth aortic arteries.<br>
            	Peripheral arteries extend from the lungs to complete the pulmonary arteries.<br>
            <b>Great Veins</b><br>
            	The sinus horns deposit into the sinus venosus, which empties into the dorsal side of the primitive atrium.<br>
            	The cardinal, umbilical and vitelline veins all converge at a sinus horn.<br>
            	On the left the coronary sinus will develop by fusion of the anterior cardinal vein, sinus horn and sinus venosus.<br>
            	The left vitelline and umbilical veins regress.<br>
            	The left posterior cardinal vein will reduce into a coronary vein.<br>
            	A pulmonary vein extends from dorsal wall of the atrium.<br>
            	On the right the venae cavae develops by fusion of the anterior cardinal vein, common cardinal vein, sinus horn, and vitelline vein.<br>
            	The right posterior cardinal and umbilical veins regress.<br>
            	Peripheral veins extend from the lungs to fuse with the pulmonary vein.<br>
            	The pulmonary vein and vena cava fuse into dorsal wall of the aorta.<br>
            	Fusion of the pulmonary vein with the dorsal wall of the atrium produces the smooth wall of the left atrium.<br>
            	Fusion of the vena cava with the dorsal wall of the right atrium produces the sinus venarum.  In the process the sinuatrial orifice of the vena cava separates into two openings, one for the superior vena cava, the other for the inferior vena cava.<br>
            <b>Interventricular Division</b><br>
            	The primitive heart segregates into two chambers, one ventricle and one atrium.  These are connected by the atrioventricular canal.<br>
            	A simple division along the interventricular sulcus would leave the right ventricle with no connection to the right atrium, and the left ventricle with no aortic outlet.<br>
            	Therefore, the division will extend through the truncus arteriosus, and the AV canal will split in two.<br>
            <b>Endocardial Cushions</b><br>
            	The atrioventricular canal begins to split when masses of tissue known as endocardial cushions form around its periphery.<br>
            	The truncus arteriosus begins to divide when masses of tissue known as swellings form.<br>
            	The swellings expand and spiral around the truncus to form conotruncal ridges.<br>
            	The caudal wall of the ventricle elongates and joins the cushions to form the interventricular septum, which divides the primitive ventricle into the left and right ventricles.<br>
            	The endocardial cushions expand to split the atrioventricular canal in two.<br>
            	The interventricular septum will divide the primitive ventricle into left and right ventricles.<br>
            	The ridges expand and coalesce to form the conotruncal septum, which divide the truncus into two channels.<br>
            	The right side of the atrioventricular canal develops into the tricuspid valve, which connects the right atrium and right ventricle.  The bicuspid valve forms on the left, connecting the left atrium and ventricle.<br>
            	An opening forms in the interventricular septum, connecting the left ventricle to the dorsal channel of truncus.<br>
            <b>Atrioventricular Valves, Bicuspids and Tricuspids</b><br>
            	Morphogenesis of the bicuspid and tricuspid valves will not be described in greater detail..<br>
            	Four masses of tissue known as endocardial cushions form around periphery of the atrioventricular canal, abbreviated A V.<br>
            	The cushions expand and fuse to split the AV canal into two openings.<br>
            	Lacunae form in the muscular tissue surrounding the orifices.  In the process, muscular cords separate from the wall of the heart.<br>
            	Connective tissue differentiates from the walls to form AV valves.<br>
            	The tricuspid valve forms between the right atrium and ventricle.<br>
            	The bicuspid valve forms between the left atrium and ventricle.<br>
            	The valves and muscles are connected by chordae tendineae.<br>
            	The muscular cords develop into papillary muscles.<br>
            <b>Flow Routes</b><br>
            	Blood flows from the right and left atriums, through the tricuspid and bicuspid valves, into the right and left ventricles respectively.<br>
            	Blood from the right ventricle flows through the ventral channel of the truncus, to the pulmonary arteries.<br>
            	Blood from the left ventricle flows through the dorsal channel of the truncus, to the aorta.<br>
            	The dorsal channel of the truncus becomes the trunk of the aorta.<br>
            	The ventral channel of the truncus becomes the trunk of the pulmonary arteries.<br>
            	Division of the primitive ventricle (and atrium), converts the primitive 2 chamber heart into  a 4 chamber heart.<br>
            <b>Interatrial Division</b><br>
            	Now let's see how the primitive atrium divides.<br>
            	Note the sinuatrial orifice is the internal opening of the sinus venosus, which connects to the primitive veins that deposit blood into the atrium.<br>
            	The sinuatrial orifice connects the venae cavae to the right side of the primitive atrium.<br>
            	Two septa develop near the midline of the primitive atrium. <br>
            	The opening to pulmonary vein is on the left side of the primitive atrium.<br>
            	The venae cavae fuse with the dorsal wall of the primitive heart to form the sinus venarum.<br>
            	In the process the sinuatrial orifice separates into two openings, one for the superior vena cava, the other for the inferior vena cava.<br>
            	The foramen separates to accommodate four pulmonary veins.<br>
            	The septum primum expands to connect to the endocardial cushions around the atrioventricular canals.<br>
                An opening persists in the septum primum known as the ostium primum.<br>
                As the ostium primum closes the septum secundum expands to connect to an endocardial cushion.<br>
                Apoptosis erodes an opening in the septum primum.<br>
                The opening that develops in the septum primum is known as the ostium secundum.<br>
                As the septum secundum expands, it eventually fuses with the endocardial cushion, leaving an opening known as the foramen ovale.<br>
                The septum secundum and primum divide the fetal heart into left and right atria.  However,  these chambers remain connected through the foramen ovale and ostium secundum.<br>
            <b>Prenatal Shunts, Foramen Ovale</b><br>
                In the fetal heart blood flows directly from the right atrium to the left atrium.  Thus, most of  the blood is shunted away from the lungs, which are not functional before birth.<br>
                As will be explained in the next section (Ductus Arteriosus), when the newborn takes the first breath, the hydrostatic pressure in the left atrium increases.  This closes the foramen ovale by pressing the septum primum against the septum secundum, which prevents blood from flowing directly from the right to left atrium.  This in turn forces blood from the right atrium  to flow through the lungs.<br>
                Approximately one year after birth, the septa primum and secundum fuse into the interatrial septum, thereby permanently eliminating the interatrial shunt.<br>
            <b>Pulmonary Bypass, Ductus Arteriosus</b><br>
                In addition to the foramen ovale, the ductus arteriosus serves as a second shunt to bypass  the fetal lungs.<br>
                Before birth prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) binds EP4 receptors to relax the smooth muscle of the ductus arteriosus, keeping it open.<br>
                The PGE2 is produced by the placenta, as well as the ductus arteriosus itself.<br>
                After birth PGE2 and EP4 receptor levels drop, allowing the smooth muscle of the ductus arteriosus to contract.<br>
                A second factor inducing ductus arteriosus constriction is bradykinin.<br> 
                With the first breath bradykinin is secreted from the lungs to bind ductus arteriosus receptors.<br>
                Ductus arteriosus induced constriction prevents blood from the right ventricle from entering the aorta, which forces it to pass through the lungs.<br>
                A third factor inducing ductus arteriosus constriction is elevated oxygen levels of the blood.<br>
                Having to force blood through the lungs is what increases the hydrostatic pressure within the contracting left atrium.<br>
                As explained previously, the increased pressure pushes the septum primum against the septum secundum, to close the foramen ovale.<br>
                The ductus arteriosus eventually regresses into a ligament known as the ligamentum arteriosum, that tethers the pulmonary artery and the aortic arch.<br> 
            <b>Prenatal Circulation</b><br>
                The routes of blood flow through the prenatal and postnatal heart will now be explained.<br>
                Blood from the placenta and embryonic body pass through the umbilical vein and vena cava to the right atrium.<br>
                The little bit of blood that passes through the lungs is deposited into the left atrium. <br> 
                Most of the prenatal blood bypasses the nonfunctional lungs by shunting it through the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus.<br>
                Some blood does pass through the prenatal lungs.  This serves to feed developing pulmonary tissue.<br>
                Most of the blood is shunted directly to the left atrium through the foramen ovale and ostium secundum.<br>
                Blood passes from the left atrium to the left ventricle.  From there it is pumped into the aorta, which carries it to the body.<br>
                Thus, most of the blood bypasses the lungs, which are nonfunctional before birth.<br>
                Some blood does pass through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle.<br>
                The blood in the right ventricle is pumped into the pulmonary arteries.<br>
                Some of the blood in the pulmonary trunk is shunted into the aorta through the ductus arteriosus. The rest passes through the lungs. This blood serves to oxygenate and nourish developing lungs tissue.<br>
            <b>Postnatal Circulation</b><br>
                After birth hydrostatic pressure increases in the left atrium to press the septum secundum against the septum primum.<br>
                The ductus arteriosus also constricts.<br>
                Thus, the shunts are closed, and blood is forced to pass through the lungs.<br>
                Deoxygenated blood passes from the body, through the vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary arteries, to the lungs.<br>
                Oxygenated blood flows from the lungs, through the left atrium, left ventricle, aorta, to the body.<br>
