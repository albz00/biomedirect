    "question": "What would be the consequence for a sperm that develops with a defect that prevents its acrosome from rupturing?",
    "Image": "",
    "answers": {
        "a": "it would bypass the first block to polyspermy",
        "b": "it would fuse with the plasma membrane",
        "c": "it would not be able to digest the zona pellucida",
        "d": "it would not be able to swell into a male pronucleus",
        "e": "it would not penetrate the corona radiata"
    },
    "correctAns": [
        "c"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "The first block to polyspermy is the corona radiata.  The acrosome does not rupture when a sperm passes through it, so there are no grounds for predicting that if the acrosome couldn’t rupture the sperm would bypass this block.",
        "b": "The acrosome must rupture for a sperm to reach the plasma membrane, so the acrosome's inability to rupture would be an obstacle to fusion; it would not promote it.",
        "c": "CORRECT: Acrosomal enzymes digest part of the zona pellucida, so the inability of the acrosome to rupture would prevent digestion.",
        "d": "Inability of the acrosome to rupture would prevent the sperm from fertilizing the egg.  Without fertilization the sperm’s nucleus would never swell into a male pronucleus.  However, this is not the best answer because this is an indirect, downstream consequence.",
        "e": "The first block to polyspermy is the corona radiata.  The acrosome does not rupture when a sperm passes through it, so there are no grounds for predicting that if the acrosome couldn’t rupture that it would prevent the sperm from passing through."

    "question": "How does the third block to polyspermy function?",
    "Image": "",
    "answers": {
        "a": "it digests the zona pellucida",
        "b": "it induces cortical granule rupture",
        "c": "it prevents acrosome rupture",
        "d": "it prevents sperm from binding the zona pellucida",
        "e": "it screens out sperm that are not capacitated"
    },
    "correctAns": [
        "d"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "The third block does not involve digestion of the zona pellucida.  The zona pellucida is the second block to polyspermy.  Digestion by acrosomal enzymes is the mechanism used to breach it.",
        "b": "Cortical granule rupture activates the third block to polyspermy; it isn’t the third block.",
        "c": "Acrosome rupture breaks down the zona pellucida, which is the first block to polyspermy.  This occurs before the third block, and the third block does not affect acrosome rupture.",
        "d": "CORRECT: The third block to polyspermy is the zona reaction, where cortical enzymes inactivate sperm binding receptors, preventing additional sperm from binding.",
        "e": "The first block to polyspermy is the corona radiata, which does prevent sperm that are not capacitated from reaching the zona pellucida.  But this occurs before the third block."

    "question": "What is the most important outcome of the first mitotic metaphase?",
    "Image": "",
    "answers": {
        "a": "binding of chromatid pairs to the mitotic spindle",
        "b": "division of the zygote into two cells",
        "c": "genomic replication",
        "d": "intermixing of the maternal and paternal genomes",
        "e": "swelling of the male and female pronuclei"
    },
    "correctAns": [
        "d"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "Chromatid pairs do bind to the mitotic spindle during metaphase, but this happens with any mitosis, so it is not unique to the first cell division.",
        "b": "The zygote does divide into two cells, but this does not occur until the first telophase, not the first metaphase.  Moreover, division into two cells is the result of any mitotic event, it is not unique to the first mitosis.",
        "c": "Replication of genomic DNA occurs during S phase, not metaphase.",
        "d": "CORRECT: All of the male and female homologs bind to the mitotic spindle during metaphase of the first mitosis, and this is when the genomes intermix.",
        "e": "The male and female pronuclei swell soon after fertilization.  The cell then passes through the cell cycle before it reaches the first mitosis."

    "question": "What do the cleavages of the early embryo accomplish?",
    "Image": "",
    "answers": {
        "a": "embryonic growth",
        "b": "morula formation ",
        "c": "production of multiple genomes",
        "d": "polar body degradation",
        "e": "tubulin"
    },
    "correctAns": [
        "c"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "The mass of the embryo does not increase during the cleavage stage.  Embryonic growth doesn’t commence until the blastocyst implants into the endometrium, when it is fortified by maternal nutrients.",
        "b": "The morula does form during the early cleavage stage, but this is just a step in the process, not the most important event.",
        "c": "CORRECT: The embryo does not grow during the cleavage stage, so there is no increase in cytoplasm.  Instead the cytoplasm is partitioned into smaller and smaller cells, which entails little more than surrounding existing cytoplasm with new plasma membranes.  However, the most important thing that needs to be created are new genomes for each daughter cell.",
        "d": "Polar bodies are degraded during the cleavage stage, but polar bodies are non-functional so this is an incidental occurrence.",
        "d": "Each new daughter cell will need its own mitotic spindle, so the blastomeres probably do synthesize new tubulin.  However, the spindle is important for one function, mitosis.  So, although spindles are critical, they do not affect every cellular process, and they are not are not the best answer."

    "question": "If compaction should fail, what would be the most immediate consequence?",
    "Image": "",
    "answers": {
        "a": "cells destined to form extraembryonic tissues would not be segregated from embryonic tissues",
        "b": "cells destined to form the outer cells would be segregated from the trophoblast",
        "c": "cells destined to segregate into the trophoblast would not differentiate into the blastocoel",
        "d": "the blastocyst would be separated from the zona pellucida",
        "e": "the inner cell mass would be destined to segregate from the trophoblast and enter the blastocoel",
        "f": "the inner cell mass would not be separated from the embryoblast"
    },
    "correctAns": [
        "a"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "CORRECT: Compaction segregates outer cells from inner cells.  Outer cells produce the trophoblast, which develops into extraembryonic tissues and only extraembryonic tissues.  The inner cells are destined to form the entire embryo, although they also derive the yolk sac and extraembryonic mesoderm.  Therefore, if compaction didn’t occur the inner and outer cells would not be segregated, and separation between embryonic and most of the extraembryonic tissues would not occur.",
        "b": "The outer cells do not segregate from the trophoblast, they are precursor cells of the trophoblast.",
        "c": "The cells of the trophoblast do not differentiate into the blastocoel.  The blastocoel is a fluid filled space that forms within the trophoblast.",
        "d": "Compaction has nothing to do with blastocyst separation from the zona pellucida.  The blastocyst separates from the zona pellucida by hatching, which occurs after compaction.",
        "e": "The inner cell mass and trophoblast do segregate as a result of compaction.  However, it is inaccurate to describe that inner cell mass as entering the blastocoel.  The blastocoel forms within the trophoblast.  The inner cell mass is pushed to the side of the blastocoel, but it remains attached to the trophoblast.",
        "f": "The word embryoblast is synonymous to inner cell mass.  A structure cannot separate from itself."
