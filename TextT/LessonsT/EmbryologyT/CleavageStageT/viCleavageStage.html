        <p><h3>Cleavage Stage</h3><br>
            <b>Overview</b><br>
                Fertilization usually occurs within 12 to 24 hours after ovulation, implantation occurs 6 days later.<br>
            <b>Ovulation</b><br>
                Sperm are transported into the Fallopian tube by peristaltic contractions of the uterus and tube,  in conjunction with ciliary action in the tube.<br>
                Fertilization typically occurs in the ampulla of the tube.<br>
                Before the sperm can be fertilized they must be prepared by a process called capacitation, which increases their motility and allows the acrosome reaction to occur.<br>
                Capacitation is believed to occur throughout the female reproductive tract.<br>
                Although fertile men deposit at least 50 million sperm, only about 300 reach the egg.<br>
                The corona radiata is the first block to polyspermy.<br>
                It screens out sperm that are deformed or not capacitated.<br>
                The zona pellucida is the second block to polyspermy.<br>
            <b>Acrosome</b><br>
            Acrosomes are enzyme rich caps around sperm nuclei.<br>
            Sperm receptors coat the Zona Pellucida.<br>
            <b>Fertilization</b><br>
            	Multiple acrosomal reactions are required to digest enough of the zona pellucida to allow one sperm to reach the egg's plasma membrane.<br>
            <b>Cortical Reaction</b><br>
            	Contact between the sperm and egg's plasma membranes leads to rupture of cortical granules on the cytoplasmic side of the egg's membrane.<br>
            <b>Zona Reaction</b><br>
            	The zona reaction is the third and final block to polyspermy.<br>
                Cortical enzymes diffuse through the egg's membrane to alter receptors in the zona pellucida<br>
                Inactivating the receptors prevents any other sperm from binding the zona.<br>
                This ensures that only one sperm will fertilize the egg.<br>
             <b>Zygote</b><br>
            	Upon fertilization the flagellum disintegrates, the sperm nucleus swells into the male pronucleus, the egg is released from metaphase II, one daughter nucleus is spit out as a polar body, the other swells into the female pronucleus.<br>
            <b>1st Cleavage</b><br>
            	The male and female pronuclei do not fuse.  Each progress through the cell cycle, separately replicating their chromosomes during S phase.  The nuclear membranes break down during the first mitotic prophase.  The sperm does not contribute a centrosome, so only one spindle forms.  The genomes intermix when the chromatid pairs attach to this spindle.  Mitosis proceeds normally from then on. <br>
                Early mitoses are referred to as cleavages.  These are a series of rapid cell divisions.<br>
                Cleavages produce multiple copies of the genome, required to form the developing embryo.<br>
                Moreover, by dividing the cytoplasm without cellular growth each time a new genome is replicated, cleavages serve to reduce the tremendous cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio produced during gametogenesis.<br>
                Thus, by the time of implantation, a more typical ratio is achieved.<br>
                Cleavages eventually produce a clump of cells known as the morula embryo (morula is Greek for mulberry).<br>
                Note, for simplicity embryos will be referred to by the approximate number of cells they possess at each stage.  However, cleavages are not synchronous in vertebrates, so cell numbers are not actually exponents of 2.<br>
            <b>Compaction</b><br>
                The eight cell morula undergoes a process known as compaction, where tight junctions form, pulling the blastomeres together.<br>
                In the process several blastomeres are pulled inward.<br>
                Scanning electron microscopy displays how the boundaries of the blastomeres are obscured by compaction.<br>
                Note, compaction is not a mitotic event.  It is a rearrangement of blastomeres.<br>
                The blastomeres pulled to the center become known as inner cells, those that remain around the periphery are outer cells.<br>
                Outer cells are committed to differentiate into extraembryonic tissues.  Inner cells produce fetal and extraembryonic tissues.  <br>
            <b>Morula</b><br>
            	As the inner cells proliferate they become known as the inner cell mass (ICM); the outer cells proliferate into the trophoblast (sometimes referred to as the outer cell mass).<br>
            <b>Blastocyst</b><br>
                The morula differentiates into the blastocyst when a fluid filled space known as a blastocoel forms.<br>
                The inner cell mass is displaced to one side of the blastocoel, where it is sometimes referred the embryoblast.<br>
                The fetus is derived entirely from the ICM, although the ICM will also produce some extraembryonic layers such as the yolk sac and extraembryonic mesoderm.<br>
                The trophoblast will only produce extraembryonic layers such as the cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast.<br>
             <b>Hatching</b><br>
                After the blastocyst reaches the uterus the zona pellucida is removed.  This is called hatching.<br>
                Note, the polar bodies degrade by apoptosis, often before hatching.<br>
                Hatching exposes the trophoblast for binding to the endometrial mucosa.<br>
            <b>Implantation</b><br><br>
            	The blastocyst implants when trophoblast cells adjacent to the ICM bind mucosa cells of the endometrium.<br>
            <b>Infertility</b><br>
                In vitro Fertilization is After gonadotropin treatment, 4 to 5 secondary oocytes are harvested intravaginally or by laparoscopy, mixed with sperm, and injected into the uterus as eight cell embryos.<br>
                Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection is when A single sperm is microinjected into the cytoplasm of an oocyte.<br>
