        <p><h3>Differentiation</h3><br>
            <b>Glossary for Differentiation</b><br>
                Stages of Differentiation<br>
                Differentiation, the process of transformation into a different cell type<br>
                Commitment, the process of restricting a cell to differentiate into a specific type<br>
                Specification, the first phase of commitment, when the fate is still reversible<br>
                Determination, the final phase, when the fate becomes irreversible.  It can only differentiate into specific cell types; not others.<br>
                Note, a cell can become committed before there are any detectable signs of differentiation.<br><br>

                Cell Properties<br>
                Differentiated Cells, specialized cells with limited or no ability to transform into other cell types <br>
                Undifferentiated Cells, cells that have not transformed into a specialized cell type<br>
                Specialized Cell Types, cells with distinctive morphological characteristics and/or molecular processes <br>
                Generalized Cell Types, cells with common traits, lacking specialized features<br><br>

                Undoing Differentiation<br>
                Dedifferentiation, for specialized cells to transform into a less specialized cell type<br>
                Metaplasia, for differentiated cells to transform into another differentiated cell type.   example given differentiation of bronchi pseudostratified epithelia into stratified squamous epithelia in smokers<br>
                Anaplasia, for cells to loss specialized features, making them unrecognizable<br>
                Neoplasia, for cells to undergo abnormal, new growth.   example given cancers<br><br>

                Progressive Restriction of Potential for Differentiation<br>
                Totipotency, ability to differentiate into any cell type.  Germ line, gametes, zygotes, early blastomeres<br>
                Pluripotency, Multipotency are ability to differentiate into multiple cell types.   example given Hematopoietic cells, fibroblasts.  Note pluripotency tends to refer to less differentiated cells, but there are no standard criteria for distinguishing pluripotency from multipotency.  For instance, many references refer to hemopoietic cells as multipotent, but others call these same cells pluripotent.<br><br>

                Differentiating Cells Types<br>
                Stem Cells are cells that can differentiate into other cells types when they divide.  They can also divide without differentiation to maintain their own population.  They tend to be pluripotent, undifferentiated & generalized<br>
                Progenitor Cells (precursors)  are cells that must differentiate when they divide.  Because they cannot divide without differentiating they cannot produce more progenitor cells to maintain their population.  Progenitors are produced by stem cell differentiation.<br>
                Blastomeres  are early embryonic cells.  Cleavage stage cells (morula and blastocyst) <br>
                Blast Cells  are stem or progenitor cells that differentiate into specific cells types.  Blast cells are named after the cell type they produce,  example given neuroblasts, myoblasts, angioblasts.<br>
                Mesenchyme, loosely organized, generalized cells, often serving as a stem cell population.  Not necessarily mesoderm, for instance neural crest cells are ectodermal mesenchyme<br><br>

                Controlling Differentiation.  See Intercellular Signaling Lesson<br>
                Autonomous Specification, intracellular signals (within a cell) controlling differentiation<br>
                Intercellular Induction, signals between cells controlling cellular differentiation<br>
                Hormones  are non-nutrient molecules secreted by a cell to induce a response in another<br>
                Growth Factors  are hormones that control growth and development<br>
             <b>Characteristics of Differentiated Cells</b><br>
                Specialized structures and/or functions<br>
                Slow or arrested cell cycle<br>
                Impaired ability to transform into other types<br>
            <b>Relative Levels of Differentiation</b><br>
                Differentiation, not an all or none process.  Some cells are more differentiated than others.<br>
                For Instance, the differentiation of a Zygote is greater than a Hematopoietic Cell is greater than a Leukocyte<br>
                Hematopoietic cells are differentiated compared to a zygote, but undifferentiated compared to a leukocyte.<br>
            <b>Differentiation Through Development</b><br>
            	During development different cells become progressively more differentiated at different rates.<br><br>
            <b>Regeneration and Differentiation</b><br>
                Generally, the more specialized, the less the ability to regenerate.   example given Skin and liver cells are generalized compared to nerve and muscle.<br>
                Skin and liver have few distinctive morphological features, while muscle has sarcomeres and syncytia, and nerves have axons and dendrites.<br>
                Skin and liver regenerate readily, nerve and muscle have virtually no ability to regenerate.<br>
            <b>Molecular Control of Differentiation,  example given Myogenesis</b><br>
            	This regulatory pathway will now be presented as an example to provide an impression for how differentiation is controlled at the molecular level.<br><br>
             <b>Skeletal Muscle Myogenesis</b><br>
            	Mesodermal mesenchyme cells of the trilaminar germ disc are undifferentiated, pluripotent stem cells.  Commitment begins with specification.  The cells are specified to undergo myogenesis by their proximity to the notochord.  Visible differentiation begins when paraxial mesodermal mesenchymal cells undergo a transition to epithelial cells of the somite.  Commitment is completed by determination, which is when the fate of the cells become irreversible. This probably occurs with the myoblasts of the myotomes.  Differentiation is completed when myoblasts fuse into a highly specialized, syncytial myocyte.<br>
            <b>My o D</b><br>
            	My o D Transforms Fibroblasts into Muscle Fibers<br>
                Fibroblasts are undifferentiated, multipotent stem cells.  One cell type that they can differentiate into is a myocyte.  It has been shown that when fibroblasts in cell culture are transformed with a gene called my o D they differentiate into myocytes.  This suggested that My o D is sufficient to induce myogenesis. <br>
            <b>Gene Knockout Mice</b><br>
                Surprisingly, myogenesis still occurred when the my o D gene was inactivated in transgenic mice.  This demonstrates that my o D is not necessary for myogenesis.<br>
                miff 5 is another gene that induces fibroblasts to differentiate into myocytes, but is not necessary for myogenesis in transgenic mice.<br>
                Inactivating both my o D and miff 5 in transgenic mice did prevent myogenesis.<br>
                The redundancy of my o D and miff 5 indicated that they are parallel components of the regulatory pathway inducing myogenesis.<br>
            <b>Helix Loop Helix</b><br>
                my o D and miff 5 are members of the helix loop helix family of transcription factors.<br>  
                It has been demonstrated that numerous H L H genes are components of the myogenic regulatory pathway.<br>  
                Transcriptional activators include My o D, miff 4, Miff 5, miff 6, Myogenin & Herculin.<br>
                The H L H transcriptional inhibitor is Id.<br>
                The ubiquitous H L H factor is E 2 A.<br>
                In non myogenic cells the negative H L H factor known as id binds the ubiquitous factor E 2 A.  Id E 2 A dimers block activation of muscle specific genes.<br>
                Positive H L H genes such as my o D and miff 5 are activated in myoblasts.  Because the positive factors are overexpressed they out compete Id for E 2 A binding.  Positive ubiquitous dimers such as My o D E 2 A activate expression of muscle specific genes such as actin and myosin.<br>
            <b>H L H Dimers Associate with MEF 2 Factors </b><br>
            	Not all components of the myogenic pathway are H L H genes.  For instance, a MADS box transcription factor known as MEF 2 interacts with H L H dimers on the promoters of many muscle specific genes.<br>
             <b>Myogenesis </b><br>
            	Wint and sonic hedgehog are growth factors secreted from the notochord that activate pax 3 and miff 6 expression in somites.<br>
                Thus, wint and sonic hedgehog represent intercellular induction that activate the following autonomous factors.<br> 
                My o D, Miff 5, MEF 2, and myogenin all bind each other's promoters to activate each other's expression.<br>
                Thus, positive feedback loops are established between the regulatory genes.  This amplifies the inductive signal, leading to myocyte differentiation.<br>
