    "explain": {
        "a": "CORRECT: As the coelom infolds it folds the endodermal sheet into the tubular midgut, and the elongation of the neural tube draws the foregut cranially and the hindgut caudally.",
        "b": "The notochord does serve as an organizer by secreting growth factors to control development of adjacent organs, but this is not a mechanical force.  The coiling gut does temporarily bulge into the ventral connecting stalk, but this occurs long after the gut becomes tubular.",
        "c": "Epiblast insertion into the hypoblast explains how the endoderm originally forms, not how it is molded into a tube.",
        "d": "The endoderm forms by invagination through the primitive streak, but this isn’t what molds the gut into a tube.  The cells of the gut do not actively migrate cranially and caudally; the foregut and hindgut are drawn out by expansion of the neural tube."

Although failure of the mesenteries to fuse with the abdominal wall would prevent the spleen from being drawn to the wall, it would still be suspended in the abdominal cavity, so it would still be intraperitoneal.",

Although the mesocolon remains attached to the abdominal wall during fusion of other mesenteries, the mesocolon itself does not fuse.
