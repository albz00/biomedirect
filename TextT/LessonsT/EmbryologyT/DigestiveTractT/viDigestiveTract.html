        <p><h3>Digestive Tract Morphogenesis</h3><br>
            <b>Embryonic Gut Formation</b><br>
                Endoderm will develop into the early gut.<br>
                As the germ disc folds ventrally, it helps to mold the endoderm into the gut tube.<br>
                Folding also constricts the connection between the gut and yolk sac to form the vitelline duct.<br>
                
            <b>Elongation of embryonic gut</b><br>
                Rapid growth of the neural tube draws the early gut, along with the surrounding coelom, into the foregut and hindgut.  The midgut is the region that remains connected to the yolk sac.<br> 
                The Foregut produces the Esophagus, Stomach, Cranial Duodenum, Pharyngeal Pouches, Lung Buds, Liver, Pancreas and Gall Bladder.<br>
                The Midgut produces the Caudal Duodenum, Small Intestine, Ascending Colon, two thirds of the Transverse Colon, Jejunum, Ileum, Cecum and Appendix.<br>
                The Hindgut produces the one third of the Transverse Colon, Descending Colon, Rectum, Upper Anal Canal, Urinary Bladder and Urethra.<br>
                
            <b>Endodermal Distribution</b><br>
                The endoderm contributes to the epithelia of numerous tissues that bud off of the gut.<br>
                
            <b>Overview</b><br>
                As the embryo grows, the endoderm elongates and infolds, to form the primitive gut.<br>
                Various organs bud from the gut.<br>
                The caudal gut coils into the intestines<br>
                The cloaca splits into the urogenital sinus and anorectal canal.  This separates the urinary and digestive tracts separate.<br>
                The digestive tract adopts its ultimate conformation when organs rotate into their final positions.<br>
                
            <b>Intestinal Coiling</b><br>
                We'll focus on the caudal end to understand how the early gut coils into the small and large intestines.<br>
                Coiling begins when the midgut extends into the connecting stalk to form the primary intestinal loop.<br>
                Next the primary loop rotates approximately 270 degrees.<br> 
                The abdominal cavity becomes crowded during this period and the intestinal loops temporarily enter the umbilical cord.<br>
                The caudal half of the loop continues coiling.  This region will form the small intestine.  The cephalic half does not coil.  It will form the large intestine.<br>
                
            <b>Appendix</b><br>
                The appendix buds of the cecal region off the large intestine, near the junction with the jejunoileal loops.<br>
                
            <b>Cloaca</b><br>
                The cloaca will develop at the caudal end of the gut, behind the allantois.<br>
                The cloaca connects to the body wall, forming an opening to the amniotic cavity.  This opening is initially covered by the cloacal membrane.<br>
                The allantois and gut empty into the cloaca.  The cloaca splits into the urogenital sinus and anorectal canal, separating the digestive and urinary tracts.<br>  
                A mesodermal fold known as the urorectal septum lies between the urogenital sinus and anorectal canal.<br>
                The urogenital sinus develops into the urinary bladder and urethra (see Urogenital System lesson).<br>   
                The anorectal canal develops into the rectum.<br>  
                
            <b>Abdominal Cavity and Mees en teries</b><br>
                Now that we've heard how the central structures of the digestive tract form, let's consider the surrounding cavities and interconnecting mees en teries.<br>
                The mesoderm that's immediately cranial to the cardiogenic field will develop into a membrane known as the septum transversum, which will help separate the coelom into abdominal and thoracic cavities.<br>
                The septum transversum is pulled caudal to the heart as body folding progresses.<br>
                The endoderm infolds to form the gut, while coeloms develop as lateral grooves on each side of the trilaminar germ disc.<br>
                As the embryo folds, the left and right coeloms infold ventrally and fuse along the ventral surface of the embryo to form one central coelom.<br>
                The gut is attached to the dorsal wall of the coelom.<br>
                The septum transversum develops into a thickened mesodermal sheet.<br>
                It will contribute to the diaphragm, which will separate the coelom into thoracic and abdominal cavities.<br>
                In the abdominal cavity the gut separates from the dorsal wall, but remains suspended by a membrane known as the dorsal mees en tery.<br>
                The ventral mees en tery develops from the septum transversum. The liver bud develops within the ventral mees en tery.<br>
                The thoracic and abdominal cavities remain connected by two holes in the diaphragm, known as pericardial peritoneal canals.<br>
                The septum transversum, along with surrounding mesoderm, develops into the diaphragm.<br>
                The medial caudal side of the septum transversum constricts into a membrane known as the ventral mees en tery.<br>  
                The ventral mees en tery extends from the stomach, lower esophagus and upper duodenum, to the ventral wall of the abdominal cavity.<br>
                As the liver grows into the abdominal cavity, it bisects the ventral mees en tery.  The dorsal region, connecting the liver and stomach is the lesser omentum.  The ventral region, attaching the liver to the abdominal wall, is the falciform ligament.<br>
                A region of the dorsal mees en tery is drawn into the primary intestinal loop.  The part connected to the large intestine is the mesocolon.  The part connected to the small intestine is the mees en tery proper.<br>
                The large intestine loops over the top of the small intestine (270 degrees) to create the colon.<br>

            <b>Diaphragm Morphogenesis</b><br>
                We'll begin by explaining how the diaphragm develops to separate the coelom into thoracic and abdominal cavities.<br>
                The diaphragm will be derived from four tissues; septum transversum, esophageal membrane, body wall muscular tissue and pleuroperitoneal membranes.<br>
                As septum transversum is attached to the ventral body wall. The pleuroperitoneal folds grow from the dorsal lateral walls.<br>
                Pleuroperitoneal canals are openings that persist between the thoracic and abdominal cavities.<br>
                The esophageal membrane is continuous with the dorsal mees en tery.<br>
                It contains the aorta, esophagus and vena cava.<br>
                When the pleuroperitoneal canals close, the pleuroperitoneal folds become known as pleuroperitoneal membranes.<br>
                Muscular tissue from the body wall grows into the pleuroperitoneal membranes and septum transversum to complete the diaphragm.<br>
                Thus, the diaphragm consists of the septum transversum, pleuroperitoneal membranes, esophageal membrane and muscular tissue from the body wall.<br>
                Pleuropericardial cavity is a more specific name for the thoracic cavity.<br>
                Pleuropericardial folds bud from the somatopleuric mesoderm to divide the pleuropericardial cavity.<br>
                As the folds extend into the cavity, lung buds grow from the esophagus.<br>
                The pleuropericardial folds eventually fuse to partition the pleuropericardial cavity into pleural and pericardial cavities.<br>
                The pericardial cavity contains the heart, the pleural cavity contains lungs.<br>

           <b>Rotations & Mees en teries</b><br>
                Abdominal organs rotate clockwise; ventral structures move right and dorsal structures move left.<br>
                The liver moves to the right, the spleen to the left, and the stomach bulges to the left.<br>  
                The colon folds into three regions.  The ascending colon is pushed to the right.  The transverse colon pivots from a dorsal ventral to a left right position.  The descending colon is pushed to the left.<br>
                The region of the dorsal mees en tery attaching the stomach to the abdominal wall becomes known as the dorsal mesogastrium.   This region is pulled to the left along with the spleen.<br>
                The region attached to the duodenum becomes known as the mesoduodenum.<br>  
                The falciform ligament moves from a ventral to cranial position, where it helps to tether the liver and diaphragm.<br>
                The dorsal mesogastrium develops into three structures.<br>
                The region attaching the spleen to the dorsal abdominal wall is the lienorenal ligament.<br>
                The region connecting the spleen and stomach is the gastrolienal ligament.<br>
                A region along the caudal surface of the stomach grows downward to form the greater omentum.  This is a double layered sac that drapes over the transverse colon and small intestines like an apron.<br>
               
            <b>Stomach</b><br>
                As the stomach bulges to the left, it rotates along two axes to change its shape.<br>
                First the stomach twists clockwise around its longitudinal axis, so that the dorsal side moves to the left, and the ventral side moves to the right.  This causes the simple tube to bulge on the left.<br>
                The original dorsal side grows faster, causing the anteroposterior axis of the stomach to rotate in a counter clockwise direction.  This creates the greater and lesser curvatures on opposite sides of the stomach.<br>
                As a result of the anteroposterior twist, the pyloric region at the caudal end of the stomach moves to the right and upward, while the cardiac region at the cranial end moves to the left and slightly downward.<br>
                
            <b>Pancreas & Bile Duct</b><br>
                Caudal to the stomach, the liver begins as endodermal tissue that buds from the duodenum and grows into the septum transversum.<br>
                The connection between the liver bud and duodenum constricts to form the bile duct.  The gallbladder buds off the bile duct, while dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds grow out of the duodenal endoderm.<br>
                The dorsal pancreatic bud grows into the mesoduodenum.<br>
                The cystic duct connects the gallbladder to the bile duct.  The hepatic duct is the section between the cystic duct and liver.<br>
                The ventral pancreatic bud is adjacent to the duodenum.<br>
                The liver, gallbladder and ducts grow in the lesser omentum.<br>
                When the abdominal organs rotate, the duodenum shifts to the right and adopts a C shape.<br>
                The ventral pancreatic bud and the proximal end of the bile duct shift dorsally.<br>
                Sections of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic ducts fuse to form the main pancreatic duct.<br>
                The pancreatic buds will fuse to form the pancreas.<br>
                
            <b>Fusions</b><br>
                Many of the mees en teries fuse with the dorsal wall of the abdominal cavity.<br>
                Fusion begins with the dorsal mesogastrium, adjacent to the spleen.<br>
                Note, these fusions occur concurrently with rotation of abdominal organs.<br>
                Fusion extends in the caudal direction.<br>
                As the mesoduodenum fuses, it draws the pancreas to the left, into a retroperitoneal position, against the dorsal wall.<br>
                Fusion and rotation leaves the spleen in an intraperitoneal position, near the left kidney, suspended between the lienorenal and gastrolienal ligaments, against but not attached to the dorsal abdominal wall.<br>
                Fusion of the mesoduodenum and mesocolon anchor the duodenum, ascending and descending colons in the retroperitoneal position, against the dorsal wall.<br>  
                The mesocolon connected to the transverse colon remains free.<br>
