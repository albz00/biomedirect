        <p><h3> Mesoderm </h3><br>
            <b>Mesoderm</b><br>
                The mesoderm is subdivided into three regions.<br>
                Paraxial mesoderm, the thickest, medial, surrounding the notochord, produces somites.<br>
                Intermediate mesoderm, between the paraxial & lateral mesoderms, produces the renal system.<br>
                Lateral mesoderm, thinnest, along the sides of the trilaminar germ disc, adjacent to the chorionic cavity, produces the coelom.<br>
                Note, the notochord is sometimes called the axial mesoderm, while the lateral mesoderm can be subdivided into lateral and more proximal lateral plate mesoderms.<br>

            <b>Paraxial Mesoderm, Somites</b><br>
                The cells of the paraxial mesoderm assemble into concentric whorls known as somites.<br>
                Multiple somites form in two rows on each side of the neural tube.<br>
                Somite formation begins in the cranial region, and progresses in the caudal direction.<br>
                The medial portions of the somites dissociate and reassemble into structures known as sclerotomes.<br>
                These will remain at the midline, where they develop into vertebrae.<br>
                The remaining portions of the somites are known as dermomyotomes.<br>
                The dermomyotomes further laminate into dermatomes and myotomes.<br>  
                Dermatomes spread around the embryo to form the banded regions of the dermis.<br>
                Myotomes elongate beneath the Dermatomes, to form the musculature of the back.<br>

            <b>Dermatomes</b><br>
                The shoulders rotate backwards while legs rotate inward.<br>
                This determines the pattern of dermatomes and underlying structures.<br>
                Dermatomes twist around the wrists with the hand.<br>
                The dermatomes around the wrists are straight and parallel when the thumb is rotated cranially.<br>
                It also reorients the feet in a forward pointing position.<br>
                Medial dermatomes encircle the trunk, distal dermatomes extend into arms and legs.<br>
                Arms and shoulders are covered by cervical dermatomes.<br> 
                Lumbar dermatomes wrap around the legs and hips.<br>
                Sacral dermatomes radiate from the anus and extend down the dorsal side of the legs.<br>

            <b>Lateral Mesoderm</b><br>
                Lateral mesoderm is often called lateral plate mesoderm.<br>
                Lacunae develop in the lateral mesoderm.<br>
                The lacunae coalesce into spaces on each side of the germ disc.  These spaces are known as coeloms.  Note, at this stage the coeloms are continuous with the surrounding chorionic cavity.<br>
                These coeloms form grooves that run down both edges of the germ disc.<br>
                The dorsal wall of each coelom is known as somatopleuric mesoderm, the ventral wall is splanchnopleuric mesoderm.<br>
                At the cranial end the lateral mesoderm does not invaginate to form a coelom.  It will develop into cranial structures such as the basilar occiput, and petrous temporal bone.<br>
                Remember that the lateral mesoderm is continuous with the extraembryonic mesoderm.<br>
                Some of the lateral mesoderm, which was derived from the primitive streak, is pushed out into the extraembryonic mesoderm.<br>
                As the germ disc grows, the coeloms turn ventrally.<br>
                Eventually the coeloms merge into a continuous, ventral cavity.<br>
                The coelom will develop into the thoracic and abdominal cavities.<br>
                The somatopleuric mesoderm contributes to the wall of our body cavities, the splanchnopleuric contributes to the coating of our digestive tract.<br>

            <b>Intermediate Mesoderm</b><br>
                The urogenital system is derived from intermediate mesoderm.<br>
                Intermediate mesoderm is positioned between somites and lateral mesoderm, on each side of the embryo.<br>
                Intermediate mesoderm constitutes two cords that run the length of the embryo.<br>
                Because the intermediate mesoderm constitutes two columns that will form the majority of the urogenital system, it is also called nephrogenic cords.<br>
                Mesodermal, nephrogenic cords run parallel to other columns such as the neural tube, gut  and notochord.<br>
