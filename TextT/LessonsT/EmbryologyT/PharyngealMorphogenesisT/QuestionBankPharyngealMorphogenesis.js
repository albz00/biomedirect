    "explain": {
        "a": "The word arch is nondescript; numerous structures can be referred to as arches, e.g. the aortic arch.  The arches described in this lesson are the pharyngeal arches.  These are cranial lateral structures consisting of neural crest cells, lateral mesoderm, and endoderm.  They do not begin as a cranial widening of the endoderm.",
        "b": "Foregut refers to the cranial third of the endoderm.  The pharynx is the cranial most part of the foregut, but it isn’t the entire foregut.",
        "c": "The larynx is a compound organ at the cranial end of the trachea, that is responsible for vocalization, breathing, and preventing aspiration of food.  It is derived from multiple precursor tissues, including pharyngeal arches, but it doesn’t begin as a cranial widening of endoderm.",
        "d": "The oropharyngeal membrane is located at the cranial end of the endoderm, but it is not itself endodermal.  It consists of juxtaposed epiblast and hypoblast.  After the endoderm develops into the gut, the membrane breaks down to form the oral opening.",
        "e": "CORRECT: The pharynx does begin as a widening at the cranial end of the endoderm.  This endodermal layer forms the medial surface of each pharyngeal arch."
