        <p><h3><b>Pharyngeal Morphogenesis</b></h3><br>
            <b>Pharynx</b><br>
                Pharyngeal morphogenesis begins with widening of the cranial end of the gut.<br>
                Pharyngeal arches develop by migration of neural crest cells into the ventral sides of the embryonic head.<br>
                Neural crest mesenchyme condenses to form cartilaginous cores in the arches.<br>
                A pharyngeal artery and muscle also form in each arch.<br>
                Four additional arches will form, caudal to the first.<br>

            <b>Pharyngeal Arches</b><br>
                There is no 5th arch in humans.  It either fails to form, or a rudiment forms and regresses.<br>  
                The first arch bifurcates into two processes known as the maxillary and mandibular prominences.<br>  
                Arteries, pouches and cores, along with the nerves and muscles, are arranged like parallel cords running through each arch.<br>
                Pharyngeal arches are bulges on the lateral sides of the embryonic head.<br>
                Pharyngeal grooves are furrows between the arches.<br>
                Pharyngeal pouches are internal furrows, adjacent to each groove.<br>
                Pharyngeal membranes are the tissue between the grooves and pouches.<br>
                The first pharyngeal groove contributes to the external ear canal, the others regress.<br>
                The pouches also contribute to the internal ear, as well tonsils, thymus and parathyroid gland.<br>
                The arches produce skeletal components including facial and hyoid bones, laryngeal cartilages, and muscles for mastication and facial expression.<br>
                The 2nd and 6th arches expand over the 3rd and 4th arches.  Thus arches 3 and 4 are internalized. The resultant cervical sinus will eventually vanish.<br> 
                The cartilaginous cores of the 4th and 6th arches will fuse to form the larynx.<br>

            <b>Facial Morphogenesis</b><br>
                The stomodeum develops into the mouth.<br>
                The otic pit develops into the inner ear.<br>
                The lens placode develops into the lens and cornea.<br>
                The nasal placode develops into nostrils.<br>
                The maxillary prominence develops into the upper jaw.<br>
                The mandibular prominence forms the lower jaw.<br>
                Pharyngeal arch 2 contributes to the hyoid.<br>
                As brain vesicles develop into the brain, their orientation shifts from perpendicular to the body axis, to in line and superior to the axis.  As a result, facial structures shift from underneath the brain vesicles to a rostral position.<br>
                The mandibular and maxillary prominences on each side of the head expand medially and fuse, forming the maxilla and mandible.<br>  
                Six auricular hillocks bud from the mandibular and maxillary prominences.  These will develop  into external ears.<br>  
                The embryo assumes a humanoid appearance early in development, about week 8.<br>
                Further development into the fetus entails enlargement of structures, remodeling their shape, and advancing the complexity of tissues.<br>
