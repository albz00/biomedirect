    "question": "An ultrasound is taken of a male fetus at 7 months gestation.  No defects are present.  Two weeks later the mother experiences severe abdominal pain, so another ultrasound is taken.  Now the fetus is missing half of his right forearm.  What is the most accurate designation for this type of defect?",

    "correctAns": [
        "c"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "The fetus’ malformation will be present when it’s born, so by definition it is a type congenital defect.  However, there are different types of congenital defects, so that is not the most precise designation for this type of defect.",
        "b": "A deformity is a defect that began when the structure first formed.  This fetus’s arm originally developed correctly, so this is not a deformity.",
        "c": "CORRECT: A disruption is when a structure originally forms correctly, but then it becomes malformed.  This is what the fetus experienced.  He probably suffered amniotic band amputation, where an amniotic band wrapped around his limb and severed the forearm.",
        "d": "This is a structural distortion of a structure, so by definition the fetus experienced a type of malformation.  However, a malformation can be produced by deformity or disruption, so malformation is not the most precise designation for this defect.",
        "e": "A syndrome is an array of multiple congenital defects that are produced by a common cause.  Only one malformation occurred with this fetus, so this is not a syndrome."

    "explain": {
        "a": "Low volume of amniotic fluid is oligohydramnios.  A blighted ovum is when a trophoblast forms without an embryo.  A blighted ovum develops before oligohydramnios, so oligohydramnios does not cause a blighted ovum.",
        "b": "Low volume of amniotic fluid is oligohydramnios.  Caudal dysgenesis is underdevelopment of caudal structures due to premature regression of the primitive streaks.  The primitive streak regresses before oligohydramnios develops, so oligohydramnios does not cause caudal dysgenesis.",
        "c": "CORRECT: Low volume of amniotic fluid is oligohydramnios, which restricts the space available within the amniotic cavity.  Crowding of the developing foot can result in clubfoot.",
        "d": "CORRECT: Low volume of amniotic fluid is oligohydramnios, which restricts the space available within the amniotic cavity.  This crowding can result in compression of joint capsules.",
        "e": "Low volume of amniotic fluid is oligohydramnios.  Although it would be logical for monoamniotic twins to be at increased risk for oligohydramnios, oligohydramnios does not cause twinning.",
        "f": "Low volume of amniotic fluid is oligohydramnios.  Polyhydramnios is the opposite, i.e. excessive volume of amniotic fluid.  Low volume cannot cause high volume."

Ultrasound demonstrates a small mass embedded in the endometrium on the right side of her uterus.  Biopsy of the mass shows that it consists of nodules like those shown by the image.

        "c": "CORRECT: The grape-like nodules are diagnostic for a hydatidiform mole.  The total lack of embryonic tissue indicates that it is a complete mole.  Complete moles result from paternal uniparental diploidy, where all the chromosomes came from the father, none from the mother.",
        "d": "The grape-like nodules are diagnostic for a hydatidiform mole.  Triploidy is when there are three copies of every chromosome in the genome.  Partial hydatidiform moles can result from triploidy, but the total lack of embryonic tissue demonstrates that this is a complete mole.",

        "b": "Any dermal abnormality above the spinal column is suspicious for spina bifida.  Failure of the neural tube to close is the cause of spina bifida, but the tube will close before birth.",
        "c": "Meninges outpouching is the defining characteristic of a meningocele.  However, a meningocele is an open neural tube defect, which means it would have penetrated through the skin.  Moreover, the hCG would have been elevated.",
        "d": "A myelomeningocele is out pouching of meninges, with neural tissue within the out pouching. However, a myelomeningocele is an open neural tube defect, which means it would have penetrated through the skin.  Moreover, the hCG would have been elevated.",
        "e": "CORRECT: Any dermal abnormality above the spinal column is suspicious for spina bifida.  This defect has not penetrated through the skin and the hCG levels are normal, so it cannot be an open defect such as a meningocele or myelomeningocele.  Therefore, if it is a neural tube defect, it must be spina bifida occulta, where there is a vertebral opening (dysraphism), but no meningeal outpouching."

        "b": "CORRECT: The only way to produce a monoamniotic pregnancy, is if the epiblast splits.  This is because by the time the epiblast forms the amnion has also form, so there is only one cavity that the twins can grow into.",
