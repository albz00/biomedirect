    "question": "At seven weeks gestation, a 27-year-old mother presents to her Ob/Gyn complaining of low energy, headaches and body pain.  Physical examination is positive for elevated fever and swollen lymph nodes.  She complains that her boyfriend never changes the litter box.  She is prescribed folic acid.  Seven month later she gives birth to a girl who is positive for blindness, enlarged liver and spleen, and cerebral palsy.  Where did she get the causative agent for the congenital defect?",
    "Image": "",
    "answers": {
        "a": "the cat",
        "b": "feces",
        "c": "fleas",
        "d": "folic acid",
        "e": "the mother’s fever"
    },
    "correctAns": [
        "b"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "The cat hosts the causative agent, so this is a correct answer. However, it isn't the best answer because she didn't acquire the agent directly from the cat.",
        "b": "CORRECT: The mother probably had toxoplasmosis, “cat scratch fever.”  The causative agent is <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, a eukaryotic, unicellular, intercellular parasite.  This pathogen is passed through a host’s feces, and cats are common hosts.  Thus, feces from the cat’s litter box is the most likely source of the causative agent.",
        "c": "Fleas transmit bubonic plague, not toxoplasmosis.",
        "d": "Folic acid does not promote birth defects; it inhibits neural tube defects.",
        "e": "Hyperthermia is teratogenic, and the mother’s fever may have contributed to the malformations, but the fever was caused by an infection and the cause of that infection is the better answer choice."

    "question": "If <i>Treponema pallidum</i> (syphilis) causes birth defects, why isn’t it a mutagen?",
    "Image": "",
    "answers": {
        "a": "It does not change DNA sequence.",
        "b": "It infects the developing embryo.",
        "c": " It interferes with developmental processes.",
        "d": "The defects that it causes are heritable.",
        "e": "<i>Treponema pallidum</i> has prokaryotic DNA."
    },
    "correctAns": [
        "a"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "CORRECT: Mutagens change DNA sequence.  <i>Treponema pallidum</i> is teratogenic, which means it interferes with development without altering DNA sequence.",
        "b": "It does infect the embryo, but that isn’t what distinguishes it from a mutagen.  A mutagen will still enter the embryo.",
        "c": "Teratogens do interfere with development, but so can mutagens.",
        "d": "<i>Treponema pallidum</i> does not change DNA sequence, so the defects that it causes are not heritable.",
        "e": "<i>Treponema pallidum</i> is prokaryotic, but DNA is not mutagenic, whether it’s prokaryotic or eukaryotic."

    "question": "Why is the teratogenic period between 3-8 weeks?",
    "Image": "",
    "answers": {
        "a": "The placenta is still developing, so it is more permissive.",
        "b": "This is a period of mitotic proliferation, making the genetic material susceptible.",
        "c": "This is the period of rapid expansion of the neural tube.",
        "d": "This is the period when the heart first beats.",
        "e": "This is the period when the primordia of most organ systems differentiate."
    },
    "correctAns": [
        "e"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "The placenta is functional by this stage; it is not less efficient at screening out detrimental factors such as teratogens.",
        "b": "Mitotic proliferation would make cells susceptible to mutagenesis, but it would not affect their susceptibility to teratogenesis. Moreover, the average rate of mitosis actually decreases by this stage, relative to the cleavage stage.  ",
        "c": "This is an example of a developing organ system that is susceptible to teratogenesis during this period.  However, it is the susceptibility of numerous organ systems that defines the teratogenic period, not just the nervous system.",
        "d": "A beating heart does not affect its susceptibility to teratogenesis.  Moreover, the earliest heart beats have been reported at 16 days post conception, 5 days prior to the teratogenic period.",
        "e": "CORRECT: Multiple organ systems are developing during this period, so this is when embryos are susceptible to multiple teratogens."

    "question": "An Ob/Gyn diagnoses a 37-year-old alcoholic with pregnancy.  He estimates that the pregnancy is at 14 weeks gestation.  Which of the following is the most important issue to inform the patient about?",
    "Image": "",
    "answers": {
        "a": "Her grandchildren are at risk for inheriting any malformations that the fetus develops.",
        "b": "The fetus is at risk for central facial defects.",
        "c": "The fetus’s IQ will be twenty points below average.",
        "d": "The pregnancy is past the teratogenic period, so her fetus is not at risk for a birth defect.",
        "e": "She should stop drinking for the duration of the pregnancy."
    },
    "correctAns": [
        "b"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "Alcohol is a teratogen, which means it interferes with development without altering DNA sequence.  If the fetus' DNA is not mutated, then any defect that develops is not heritable, and the grandchildren are not at risk.",
        "b": "CORRECT: The mother is alcoholic, so she probably drank during the teratogenic period (3-8 weeks).  Therefore, the risk is high that the fetus already developed fetal alcohol syndrome, and it is important to warn her that the fetus is at risk of developing symptoms such as central facial defects (holoprosencephaly).",
        "c": "Intellectual deficiency is another symptom of fetal alcohol syndrome, so the fetus is at risk for decreased IQ.  However, the symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome vary, and it is not possible to predict that the fetus's IQ will decrease by exactly 20 points.  Moreover, it is possible that the fetus has not developed fetal alcohol syndrome despite the mother’s drinking, so it would be inappropriate to definitively state that her fetus will have any symptom.",
        "d": "Just because the pregnancy is past the teratogenic period does not mean that a defect hasn’t already developed, nor that it couldn't still develop.",
        "e": "The teratogenic period is a time when the fetus is at greatest risk, but there is still a decreased risk that defects could develop after the period.  Therefore, the mother should be advised to stop drinking.  However, this isn’t the most important thing to tell her because she presumably drank during the teratogenic period, so the risk is already high that the fetus has fetal alcohol syndrome."
