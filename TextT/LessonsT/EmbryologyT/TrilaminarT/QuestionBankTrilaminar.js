        "a": "CORRECT: 2 points to the outer epiblast.  The outer epiblast doesn’t reach the streak, and becomes the ectoderm.  Moreover, the epiblast is the primordium for the entire fetus, and the fetus is derived entirely from the epiblast.",
        "b": "2 points to the epiblast.  The earliest epiblast cells to invaginate through the primitive streak do become endoderm.  However, the trophoblast forms before the epiblast and no epiblastic cells contribute to the trophoblast.  The trophoblast is the outer cell layer of the implanted blastocyst.",
        "c": "2 points to the epiblast, so it’s inappropriate to say it forms from itself.  The epiblast does constitute half of the bilaminar germ disc, but the other half is the hypoblast which does not formed from epiblast.",
        "d": "2 points to the epiblast.  Epiblast cells that invaginate through the streak to be deposited between the ectoderm and endoderm, do constitute the mesoderm.  However, the hypoblast is not derived from the epiblast.  Both the hypoblast and epiblast are derived from the inner cell mass.",

    "explain": {
        "a": "The notochord is mesodermal, derived from cells that invaginate through the streak.  It is not ectodermal, which is composed of epiblast cells that do not reach the streak.  The neurenteric canal is the lumen within the hollow notochordal process.  However, the neurenteric canal is obliterated when the process fuses with the endoderm to become the notochordal plate.  The true notochord forms later, so the notochord does not develop into the canal.",
        "b": "CORRECT: The notochord is composed of mesodermal cells that invaginate through Hensen’s node and remain contiguous.  When the notochord regresses it leaves nuclei pulposi within the intervertebral discs.",
        "c": "The notochord is a mesodermal structure, but the spinal cord is ectodermal and the notochord does not contribute to it.  Nuclei pulposi do contribute to the vertebral column which surrounds the spinal cord, but these are separate from the cord.",
        "d": "The primitive groove runs the length of the primitive streak behind Hensen’s node, but the notochord is derived from cells that invaginate through the node not the groove, so the notochord does not come from the groove. Mesenchymal mesoderm is composed of the cells that invaginate through the groove, so it is not derived from the notochord.",
        "e": "The primitive pit is the hole in the center of Hensen’s node.  It becomes the neurenteric canal as the notochordal process elongates.  However, the neurenteric canal is obliterated when the notochordal process fuses with the endoderm to become the notochordal plate.  The plate later gives rise to the notochord.  Therefore, the pit does not make a direct contribution to the notochord. The prechordal plate is composed of the very first endodermal cells to invaginate through the streak.  It migrates ahead of the notochord, but it is not derived from the notochord."

        "c": "The notochord does not migrate in the cranial direction.  Before primitive streak regression, the notochordal process and plate do, but they’re not what the question asked about.  It asked about the notochord.",

    "question": "A graduate student proposes monitoring elongation and regression of Hensen’s node by staining the cells of Hensen’s node soon after it appears.  He wants to measure the cranial most location of the stained node, how long it takes to reach that point, how long it takes to migrate back to the caudal end, and where the stained cells become located after the node regresses.

    "answers": {
        "a": "The stain would diffuse out of the cells of the node and spread throughout the ectoderm.",

        "d"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "The cells of Hensen’s node migrate through the mesoderm and fuse with the endoderm.  Therefore, if a stain were to diffuse into surrounding tissue, that tissue would most likely be endoderm or mesoderm, not the ectoderm.",
        "b": "Hensen’s node is not absorbed into the primitive grooves.",
        "c": "Cells do invaginate through Hensen’s node, but they remain contiguous to form the notochordal process, not the mesenchymal mesoderm.  The mesenchymal mesoderm is a loosely organized population of cells that form by invagination through the primitive groove, not Hensen’s node.",
        "d": "CORRECT: Henson’s node, like the rest of the primitive streak, is not a static structure.  It is best thought of as the dynamic phenomenon, with cells invaginating inward to form the notochord.  Therefore, the stain would not remain in the node; it would wind up in the notochord.",
        "e": "The cells of the node do not pass through the neurenteric canal to enter the yolk sac.  They remain contiguous to form the notochordal process.  The neurenteric canal is the lumen of that process. So notochordal cells constitute the wall of the process, not its lumen. "
