        <p><h3><b>General Cytogenetics</b></h3><br>
            <b>Indications for Cytogenetic Analysis</b><br>
                First indication, a patient with features suggestive of a cytogenetic syndrome<br>
                Due to variability, no symptoms are pathognomonic<br>
                Aneuploidies, mosaics and aberrations can all have the same symptoms<br>
                Few symptoms occur in 100% of the patients with a specific disease, and most of the symptoms occur with multiple cytogenetic and teratogenic diseases.<br>
                Therefore, few symptoms are pathognomonic and cytogenetic analysis is usually required to definitively diagnose a cytogenetic or teratogenic disease.<br>
                Second indication, a patient with Unusual symptoms such as intellectual disability or short stature<br>
                Third indication, a stillborn infant with multiple malformations<br>
                Forth indication, a Couple with 2 or more unexplained pregnancy losses<br>
                Chance of finding abnormality is approximately 5%<br>
                Fifth indication, a Patient with cancer<br>
                Sixth indication, Parents of a child with an aberration<br>
                If they are carriers, subsequent progeny could be affected<br>

            <b>Karyotype Preparation</b><br>
                Purify Leukocytes by Centrifugation<br>
                This step is typically omitted<br>
                Culture Leukocytes<br>
                Treat with Mitogen to Induce Mitosis<br>
                Suspend Mitotic Figures with Colcemid<br>
                Incubate in Hypotonic potassium chloride to Swell Cells & Untangle Chromosomes<br>
                Fix Mitotic Chromosomes with Acetic Acid & Methanol, then Stain ( example given Giemsa Dyes, FISH Probes, etc.) <br>
                Cells must be viable to divide, so do not send samples in formaldehyde.<br>
                Tissues Commonly used for Cytogenetic Analyses<br>
                Mitogen required, Culture Time 3 to 4 Days, used for Post Natal Diagnosis<br>
                Bone Marrow, Mitogen not required, Culture Time 0, 24 or 48 hours, used to diagnose Malignancies<br>
                Amniocytes, Mitogen not required, Culture Time 7 to 10 Days, used for Prenatal Diagnosis<br>
                Chorionic Villi, Mitogen not required, Culture Time 7 to 10 Days, used for Prenatal Diagnosis<br>
                Other Tissues, Culture Time 14 to 21 Days, Examples Mosaics, Postmortems, Spontaneous Abortions<br>

            <b>Chromosomal Structure</b><br>
                A chromosome is divided by the centromere into two domains, called arms. The shorter is the p arm, the longer is the q arm.  p stands for petite.  q is the next letter in the alphabet.<br>
                Tightly coiled, heterochromatic regions take up more stain and form dark bands, looser euchromatic regions form light bands.<br>
                G bands are regions stained with Geimsa stain.  Other stains are used to produce similar banding patterns such as Q, R & C bands.<br>
                Bands are numbered from the centromere outwards.  The first number denotes the major band.   The second number denotes a sub band.<br>
                Examples p1 3 denotes band 1, sub band 3 of the short arm. q3 1.3 stands for band 3, sub band 1.3, of the long arm.<br>
                Chromosomes are classified based on the position of their centromere.<br>
                Metacentric, centromere near the center of the chromosome<br>	
                Submetacentric, centromere Off Centered<br>
                Acrocentric, centromere Towards the End<br>
                Telocentric, centromere At the End, the telomere also serves as the centromere<br>
                Telocentric chromosomes Occur in Mice, not Humans<br>
                The centromere of an acrocentric chromosome is very near one of its ends.  The chromosome usually has two regions known as satellites, which are at the ends of short stalks.  These stalks contain repetitive rRNA genes, but there are few if any other genes in the stalks or satellites.<br>
                The Y chromosome is acrocentric, although it does not have satellites.<br>
                As will be explained later in this lesson, acrocentric chromosomes are subject to Robertsonian translocations.<br>

            <b>Human Karyotype</b><br>
                Chromosomes are designated in reverse.<br>
                Lower numbers are assigned to larger chromosomes, higher numbers for smaller chromosome.<br>
                By convention the human karyotype is grouped into clusters of the same centromeric class.<br>
                Acrocentric Chromosomes, Subject to Robertsonian Translocations<br>
                The viable Aneuploidies are Trisomy 13, Patau’s, Trisomy 18, Edwards, Trisomy 21, Down’s, X Monosomy, Turner’s, extra X, XXY, Klinefelter, Trisomy X, XXX, and extra Y, XYY<br> 
                These are all Small Chromosomes with Fewer Genes <br>
                Trisomy X and Extra Y have Minor to No Symptoms<br>

            <b>Karyotype Designation</b><br>
                General Rule, the number of chromosomes is denoted first, then the sex chromosomes, and last the abnormality, if any.<br>
                There are two types of euploidies.<br>
                The first is the normal, diploid genome, designated 46, XN<br>
                The second are polyploidies such as Tetraploidy, designated 92, XYNN<br>
                N is a variable.  It stands for either X or Y.<br>
                For Aneuploidies the abnormality is denoted by the number of the affected chromosome.<br>
                For trisomies, a plus suffix denotes the extra chromosome. For monosomies a negative symbol denotes the missing chromosome.<br>
                Example, 47, XX, +13<br>
                This is a female, with 47 chromosomes, which is one too many.  The extra is chromosome 13.<br>
                Therefore, she has Patau syndrome (trisomy 13).<br>
                The aneuploidies that survive in humans are<br>
                The Aneuploidies are<br>
                Down’s Trisomy 21, 47, X X, +21 <br>
                Edwards Trisomy 18, 47, X X, +18, <br>
                Patau’s Trisomy 13, 47, X X, +13, <br>
                Turner’s Monosomy X, 45, X, <br>
                Klinefelter’s Extra X, 47, X X Y, <br>
                Extra Y, 47, X Y Y<br>
                X triploidy, 47, X X X<br>
                For Chromosomal Aberrations<br>
                The abnormality is designated by first denoting the type of aberration.<br> 
                Then in parentheses the number/s of the chromosome/s with the aberration/s, <br>
                Then in parentheses the chromosomal segment/s involved with the aberration/s (defined by denoting the G bands of the segment/s).<br>
                Example 46, XX, dup parentheses 17, parentheses p1 2 p1 2<br>
                With this example sub band 2 of band 1 of the short arm of chromosome 17 is duplicated. This patient has Charcot Marie Tooth disease.<br>
                Chromosomal Aberrations include<br>
                46, X Y, del(5)(p1 5), Deletion of band 1, sub band 5, or the short arm of chromosome 5.  This is cri du chat.<br>
                46, X X, dup(17)(p1 2 p1 2), Duplication of band 1, sub band 2, of the short arm of chromosome 17.  This is Charcot Marie Tooth disease<br>
                46, X X, inv(8)(p1 1 q1 3), Inversion from band 1, sub band 1 of the short arm to band 1, sub band 3 of the long arm, of chromosome 8.  This is Acute Myeloid Leukemia<br>
                46, X X, ins(8; 5)(p2 3;q3 3 q3 5), Insertion from band 3, sub band 3, to band 3, sub band 5 of the long arm of chromosome 5, into band 2, sub band 3 of the long arm of chromosome 8.  This is a balance aberration.<br>
                46, X Y, t(8; 14)(q2 4.1; q3 2), Reciprocal translocation between the long arm of chromosome 8, from band 2, sub band 4.1, to the end, and the long arm of chromosome 14, from band 3, sub band 2 to the end.  This is Burkitt’s Lymphoma.<br>

            <b>Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization</b><br>
                Abbreviated FISH<br>
                This is a modern technique that has become more common than chromosome banding because it is less time consuming and requires less expertise to interpret the results.  Moreover, it allows detection of smaller chromosomal aberrations.<br>
                DNA probes are prepared by replicating fragments with dNTPs that have fluorescent moieties.<br>
                The most common method for replicating the DNA is PCR.<br>
                Short strands of fluorescent DNA are produced that are complimentary to a specific sequence on a chromosome.<br>
                The probes are taken up by cells in tissue culture.<br>
                Once in the cytoplasm, cells automatically transport DNA into their nuclei.<br>
                When a probe binds a complementary sequence, the fluorochromes cause the site to fluoresce under ultraviolet light.<br>
                FISH can be performed with interphase or metaphase cells.<br>
                With interphase FISH cells are incubated with the probe. These cells can be living or not.  The fluorescent spots demonstrate chromosomal sequences that are complimentary to the probe.  The location of these sequences on the chromosomes cannot be determined.<br>
                With metaphase FISH, living cells are treated with Colcemid to produce Mitotic Figures, which are then fixed with Acetic Acid & Methanol.  This treatment is more involved than interphase FISH, but it does allow locations on chromosomes to be pin pointed.<br>
                FISH can detect submicroscopic chromosomal aberrations that cannot be seen by G banding,  example given microdeletions.<br>
                FISH is also convenient for counting chromosomes, because with FISH all a technologist has to do is count fluorescent spots.  Thus, FISH is useful for diagnosing aneuploidies and polyploidies.<br>
                Locus specific probes are complimentary to specific sites.<br>  
                Centromeric probes bind centromeres.  These facilitate counting or identifying chromosomes.<br>
                Counting diagnoses aneuploidies and polyploidies.<br>
                Telomeric probes bind telomeres. They are useful for counting or identifying chromosomes.<br>
                Chromosome paints consist of cocktails of locus specific probes across entire chromosomes. These allow identifying and counting chromosomes.<br>

            <b>Classes of Cytogenetic Defects </b><br>
            <b>Polyploidy Etiology, Polyspermy</b><br>
                Polyploidies are when there are more than two complete genomes.  Example given, triploidy where there are three copies of every chromosome.<br>
                The blocks to polyspermy slow down penetration and minimize the chance that two sperm will fertilize an egg.  However, if two sperm simultaneously reach the egg's plasma membrane then both will penetrate the cytoplasm.  This results in triploidy, where the individual contains three complete sets of chromosomes.<br>
                Triploid Fates<br>
                Spontaneous Abortion, Most Common, Often Before the mother Realizes she’s Pregnant <br>
                Partial Hydatidiform Mole, Little Fetal Tissue, Grape Like Villi, Risk for Choriocarcinoma<br>
                To Term, Malformed, 100% Neonatal Mortality <br>
                Regardless of the fate, Polyploidy is incompatible with life.<br>

            <b>Aneuploidies</b><br>
                Aneuploidies are when there are the wrong number of homologs for a chromosome.<br>
                Monosomy, one homolog of a chromosome,  example given Turner<br>
                Trisomy, three homologs of a chromosome,  example given Down<br>
                Aneuploidies are different from polyploidies because they only involved one chromosome.  There will be one or three homologs of the chromosome, not three copies of every chromosome in the genome.<br>
                Etiology, Nondisjunction<br>

            <b>Genetic Mosaics Zygote (Fertilized Egg) </b><br>
                To understand how genetic mosaics arise, we will follow development during the cleavage stage.<br> 
                Nondisjunction does not only occur during meiotic division.  It can also occur during mitosis.  When this happens in an adult it only produces a few aneuploid cells. The problem occurs when it happens in an early embryo.<br>
                All descendants of the trisomic cell produced by the mitotic nondisjunction will inherit the trisomy.<br>
                Thus, an embryonic nondisjunction produces an individual with a mixture of trisomy and normal cells.<br>  
                Mosaic patients tend to have fewer and more variable symptoms.<br>
                Note, lyonization produced by X inactivation is a completely different type of genetic mosaic.<br>
                Liston to Sexual Genetics lesson<br>

            <b>Chromosomal Aberrations</b><br>
                The final class of cytogenetic defect is the chromosomal aberrations.  These are structural damage to chromosomes such as regions that are cut out or moved.<br>

            <b>Etiology, DNA Ligase Error Balanced Aberrations</b><br>
                Chromosomal aberrations result from DNA cleavage.  Note, there must be at least two breaks in the DNA to produce an aberration.  If there's only one break then DNA ligase will simply put the two fragments back together.<br>
                DNA ligase automatically joins any free 3' OH and 5' phosphate.  It has no mechanism for determining the original configuration of DNA fragments, so it can ligate them to the wrong segment, or in the wrong orientation, producing a chromosomal aberration<br>

            <b>Balanced Aberrations</b><br>
                Balanced aberrations are cytogenetic defects that have no phenotype.<br>  
                They are said to be silent.<br>
                Criteria<br>
                No essential chromosomal material is lost.<br>
                No breakpoints are within an essential gene.<br>
                No gene is moved away from its promoter or enhancer, or to another regulatory region.<br> 
                Balanced translocations are silent carriers, but their progeny may or may not be affected.<br>

            <b>Reciprocal, Terminal Translocation</b><br>
                With a reciprocal translocation the ends of two chromosomes are exchanged.<br>
                They are typically Balanced because there’s little if any Loss of Genetic Material.<br>
                Offspring who inherit both intact chromosomes from the carrier parent, they will be free of the aberration.<br>
                Offspring who inherit both damaged chromosomes will be balanced, wild type carriers like their carrier parent.<br>
                The problem occurs if an offspring inherits one translocated and one intact chromosome.<br>
                They will have Duplication, deletion mutations because they will have three copies of one fragment, one copy of the other.<br>
                Even though parents, siblings and other relatives are wild type, they can still be carriers.  This is why it is important to perform cytogenetic analyses for family members.<br>

            <b>Insertion</b><br>
                If a fragment is excised from one chromosome and inserted into another, the aberration will usually be balance because there is little if any loss of genetic information.<br>
                Problems can arise in the next generation.<br> 
                If offspring inherit a defective and an intact homolog from the carrier parent, they will be unbalanced.<br>
                These are referred to as partial trisomies because they have three copies of the translocated region.<br>
                As with genetic mosaics, patients with partial trisomies tend to have fewer and more variable symptoms.<br>

            <b>Robertsonian Translocation</b><br>
                Acrocentric chromosomes are subject to a special type of aberration known as a Robertsonian translocation.<br>
                Robertsonian translocations occur after stalks are cleaved from two acrocentric chromosomes, and the q arms are ligated together.<br>
                Each stalk contains numerous rRNA genes.  However, there is a multitude of other rRNA genes on the stalks of other acrocentric chromosomes, so there is little to no effect on phenotype.<br>
                Moreover, there are still two copies of the q arms.<br>
                Therefore, Robertsonian translocations are balanced.<br>
                The problem arises with offspring because they inherit trisomies.  They receive two copies of the q arm from the Robertsonian translocation, and one copy from the wild type parent.<br>
                Note, they still have 46 chromosomes because two q arms are tied together, producing one chromosome.<br>
                Chromosome 21 is acrocentric, so Down syndrome can be produced from Robertsonian translocations.  The karyotype is written 46, XY, rob(21;21)(q10;q10) <br>
                Most Robertsonian translocations occur between different acrocentric chromosomes.  21 & 14 are relatively common.  The karyotype is written 46, XX, rob(14;21)(q10;q10) <br>
