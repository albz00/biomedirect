        <p><h3><b>Inheritance Patterns</b></h3><br>
            <b>Non Mendelian</b><br>
                Mendelian Traits, Autosomal Recessive Inheritance Patterns<br>
                Non  Mendelian Traits, Any Other Inheritance Pattern<br>

            <b>Genetic Variability </b><br>
                Genetic Variability is Differences in Degree of the Phenotype Produced by the Same Genotype<br>
                Evaluated by Familial Studies Correlating Differences with Relationship, Twin Studies<br>
                Example given, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Brittle Bone Disease<br>
                Severity Can Differ Amongst Relatives with the Same Mutation<br>
                Some Able to Withstand Greater Forces, Some Have More Fractures<br>
                Brittle bones are the distinguishing symptom of OI. <br>
                Blue sclerae occurs with most types of OI. <br>
                Skeletal deformities also occur with most types.  The severity of these deformities varies with the type and individual case. <br>
                Other symptoms that commonly occur with different types of OI include short stature, dentinogenetic imperfecta, hearing loss, loose joints, poor muscle tone and respiratory problems.<br>

            <b>Penetrance</b><br>
                Incomplete or Partial Penetrance is a mutation that does not produce the mutant phenotype in everyone who inherits the mutant genotype<br>
                Note this is not variability.  The question is whether the patient demonstrates any symptoms or not, all or none, not the number or severity of symptoms.<br>  
                Penetrance, the fraction of individuals with a mutant genotype who manifest the mutant phenotype
                If only 30% of homozygotes for a recessive mutation are affected, then the penetrance is 30%.<br>
                If all homozygotes are affected, the penetrance is 100%.<br>
                A Penetrant is a mutated individual who demonstrates the phenotype<br>
                Examples, BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer<br>
                Both are Autosomal Dominant, Tumor Suppressors involved with DNA Repair <br>
                Risks of women developing breast cancer with BRCA1 is about 85% by age 65 years<br>
                With BRAC2 the lifetime risk is about 35% <br>
                Thus 15% of women with a BRCA1 mutation, and 65% with a BRCA2 mutation, never develop breast cancer.<br>
                Although BRCA mutations do increase the risk of breast cancer, neither is required.<br>
                95% of women with breast cancer do not have a BRCA mutation.<br>
                Other Risks with BRCA Mutations<br>
                Ovarian (≈40% for BRCA1), Bowel and Prostate Cancers<br>
                The risk of Males developing Breast Cancer with BRCA2 is about 6%.  There is no increased risk for males with BRCA1.<br>

            <b>Multiple Gene Patterns</b><br>
                These inheritance patterns all involve multiple genes, multiple alleles, or multiple traits.<br>
                Multifactorial Traits, phenotypes determined by multiple factors, both genetic and environmental<br>
                Polygenic Traits, phenotypes determined by multiple genes<br>
                Heterogeneity, different mutations producing similar phenotypes<br>
                Pleiotropy, for a single gene to control multiple traits<br>
                Polymorphism, two or more alleles for a gene in a population, each with an allelic frequency (q) above 5%<br>

            <b>Genetic Heterogeneity</b><br>
                Genetic Heterogeneity (Genocopy) , Similar Phenotypes Produced by Different Mutations<br>
                Genetic heterogeneity is subdivided into allelic and locus heterogeneity.<br>
                Allelic Heterogeneity , different mutations in the same gene producing similar phenotypes<br>
                Locus Heterogeneity , mutations in different genes producing similar phenotypes<br>
                Examples of Allelic Heterogeneity<br> 
                Cystic Fibrosis , Over 1000 CFTR mutations, delta 508 is the most common<br>
                Osteogenesis Imperfecta (18 types have been identified) <br>
                The first 4 types are collagen mutations, COL1A1 or COL1A2.<br>
                OI2 most serious with intrauterine fractures and prenatal mortality<br>
                Locus Heterogeneity Examples<br>
                Severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCIDS), null mutations of the genes for adenosine deaminase, which is autosomal recessive, or gamma Cytokine receptor, which is  X Linked recessive.<br>
                 Ehlers Danlos Syndromes, mutations of lysyl oxidase, lysyl hydroxylase, and multiple collagen genes<br>
                Thalassemias (10 types) , different mutations within the α or β globin genes<br>
                Congenital Deafness, mutations of over 75 genes<br>
                Autosomal Dominant Deafness Genes, At least 75 known genes are involved with deafness.<br>
                Gap junction proteins (most common), GJB2, GJB3, GJB6 (Connexins) <br>
                Tectorial membrane proteins, TECTA, COL11A2<br>
                Developmental regulators, EYA4, POU4F3, Ion Channels, KCNQ4<br>
                Myosins, MYH9, MYO6, MYO7A Cytoskeletal proteins, DIAPH1<br>
                Function unknown, TMC1, COCH, DFNA5, WFS1<br>

            <b>Pleiotropy</b><br>
                For a Single Gene to Control Multiple Traits<br>
                Examples include Cystic Fibrosis, Phenylketonuria, Hurler's Syndrome, Marfan’s Syndrome, Achondroplasia, Neurofibromatosis<br>
                Marfan’s Syndrome<br>
                Autosomal Dominant<br>
                Caused by mutations in Fibrillin Gene<br>
                Symptoms, Tall Stature, Long Thin Extremities, Arachnodactyly, Dolichostenomelia, Pectus Excavatum, Myopia; dislocated lenses, Aortic root dilatation; risk for aortic aneurysms<br>
                Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) <br>
                Symptoms, Peripheral Neurofibroma (>99%), Hyperpigmented Macules (>99%), Lisch Nodules (90 to 95%), Axillary Freckling (67%), Macrocephaly (45%), Learning Difficulties (25 to 40%), Optic Nerve Gliomas (1.5% to 15%), CNS Tumors (1.5%) <br>
                Neurofibromas, Dermal Nodules, Sessile, Pedunculated, usually arise during adolescence or early adulthood, may increase in size and number during pregnancy<br>
                On Breasts Neurofibromas should not be confused with the tubercles of Montgomery that normally encircle the areola.<br>
                Hyperpigmented Macules, which are Dark dermal patches<br>
                They’re called cafe au lait spots because on Caucasians their color is similar to coffee.<br>
                The NF1 Gene, Gene product, Neurofibromin, an effector of a cAMP signaling pathway known as a GTPase Activating Protein<br>
                The highest mutation rate observed in humans occurs with the NF1 Gene (1/10,000 gametes) <br>

            <b>Codominance</b><br>
                Different Alleles Inducing Independent Effects on the Phenotype<br>
                Example Blood Groups<br>
                I A I A Genotype,  Blood Type  A phenotype<br>
                I B I B Genotype, Blood Type B phenotype<br>
                I A I B Genotype, Blood Type A B phenotype<br>
                The A phenotype does not reject type A blood.<br>
                The B phenotype does not reject type B blood.<br>
                The AB phenotype does not reject either. It is not A or B, it is both.<br>

            <b>Polymorphism</b><br>
                Two or more Alleles in a Population<br>
                Example Blood Groups<br>
                I A lower case i, recessive, Blood Type A<br>
                I B lower case i, Blood Type  B<br>
                lower case i lower case i, Blood Type  O<br>
                A new mutation is defined as a polymorphism if its allelic frequency reaches 5% or more.<br>

            <b>Mitochondrial Inheritance</b><br>
                Maternal Inheritance, transmission from mothers to all children regardless of sex, never transmitted from fathers to any children.<br>
                Heteroplasmy , mixed intracellular populations of mitochondria with mutant and wild type genomes.<br>
                Because the proportions of mutant and wild type mitochondria can change, symptoms can vary from generation to generation, or even during the lifetime of an individual.<br>
                Example 1, Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy<br>
                Symptoms, Optic Atrophy Leading to Blindness, Telangiectatic Microangiopathy (small spider like capillaries) <br>
                Point mutations of components of NADH dehydrogenase complex I subunits (ND1, ND4, ND4L & ND6), blocking oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis.<br>
                Example 2, Kearns Sayre Syndrome<br>
                Symptoms, Ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of eye muscles), Ptosis (difficulty opening eye), Pigmentary Retinopathy, Hypoparathyroidism, Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities, Diabetes, Deafness<br>
                Different genes lost with different microdeletions of mitochondrial DNA lead to this disease, including components of oxidative phosphorylation<br>

            <b>Anticipation</b><br>
                A mutant phenotype that increases in severity each generation <br>
                Example, Fragile X Syndrome<br>
                Grandmother, No Symptoms, Daughter, Moderate Symptoms, Grandson, Severe Symptoms<br>

            <b>Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion (FMR1) </b><br>
                Anticipation caused by Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion<br>
                C G G trinucleotide repeats are located in the 5' U T R of the wild type F M R 1 gene.<br>
                A grandparent will have the normal number of trinucleotide repeats, 6 to 54.<br>
                A parent in the next generation inherits 55 to 200 repeats.<br>
                This is known as a Premutation<br>
                This parent will have moderate symptoms.<br>
                This expansion occurs during oogenesis in the parent’s ovaries.<br>
                The number of repeats in the grandchild will increases even further, to over 200.<br>
                These repeats attract methylation.<br>
                The promoter, which is adjacent to the repeats, becomes methylated along with the repeats.<br>  
                This prevents expression of the FMR1 gene.<br>
                The gene product of the FMR1 gene is FMRP<br>
                FMRP is a Chaperone Protein for Cerebral mRNAs<br>
                Lack of FMRP results in fragile X syndrome.<br>
                Anticipation is produced by trinucleotide repeat expansion.<br>

            <b>Fragile X</b><br>
                Fragile X Chromosome<br>
                The Xq27.3 site shows a constriction that fails to stain.<br>
                The constriction is produced by the expansion of the trinucleotide repeats.  This region is prone to breakage in tissue culture cells grown in the absence of folic acid.  This fragility is an in vitro phenomenon.  It does not occur in a patient's cells.<br>
                Inheritance pattern, X Linked Dominant, Partial Penetrance, about 55% in females, anticipation
                Symptoms<br>
                Moderate IQ, Most common heritable intellectual disability, second only to Down's<br>
                Hyperactivity, Hand flapping, Biting, Temper tantrums, Poor eye contact<br>
                After Puberty, Long face, Prominent jaw and forehead, Large ears, Macro orchidism (large testicles)<br>

                Spinocerebral Ataxia 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 17, Repeat GAG>CTG, normal number from 1 to 31 to 25 to 42, affected number from 20 to 33 to 36 to 460, inheritance autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive, genes ATXN 1,2,3,7,80S TBP OR CACNA1A, region Exon more than 3 prime U T R<br>
                Spinocerebral ataxia is caused by trinucleotide expansion in at least 7 genes, locus heterogeneity, and a composite summary was just listed.<br>

            <b>Epigenetic Imprinting</b><br>
                A mutant genotype with a different phenotype depending on context, for instance the sex of the parent<br>
                Imprinting refers to genomic reprograming, typically by methylation.  This is the basis of epigenetics.<br>
                Examples Prader Willi and Angelman’s Syndromes<br>

            <b>Example 1, Prader Willi  Syndrome</b><br>
                Symptoms<br>
                poor neonatal feeding <br>
                The compulsive feeding commences 12 to 18 months after birth.<br>
                Obesity due to excessive eating.<br> 
                Obesity is the most distinguishing symptom of this disease.<br>
                Neonatal hypotonia which gradually improves<br>
                Mild intellectual disability<br>
                Behavior problems<br>
                Almond shaped eyes<br>
                Upslanted palpebral fissures<br>
                Bitemporal narrowing<br>
                Small hands and feet<br>
                Hypopigmentation<br>
                Microorchidism<br>
                Small genitalia, penis, clitoris, scrotum, labia<br>

            <b>Example 2, Angelman’s Syndrome</b><br>
                Paroxysms of laughter, happy disposition<br>
                Jerky, ataxic movements, “puppet like” gait<br>
                Arm posturing<br>
                Severe intellectual disability<br>
                Absent speech<br>
                Microcephaly<br>
                Prominent mandible<br>
                Pointed chin<br>
                Wide mouth<br>
                Widely spaced teeth<br>
                Thin upper lip<br>
                Seizures<br>
                Hypopigmentation<br>
                The most distinguishing characteristics are laughter, ataxia and intellectual disability.<br>
                Thus, Prader Willi  and Angelman’s are different syndromes with very different symptoms.<br>

            <b>Microdeletion</b><br>
                FISH can be used to diagnose Angelman’s Syndrome<br>
                A locus specific probe for 15q12 is used.<br>
                This is the region responsible for Angelman’s.<br>
                If both homologs are marked by the Angelman’s probe, the patient does not have Angelman’s.<br>
                If only one homolog is marked, the 15q12region is deleted, confirming that the patient has Angelman’s syndrome.<br>
                The informative result was that when chromosomes from a Prader Willi  patient was probed with the 15q12 fragment, only one homolog was marked.<br>
                Lack of Angelman’s signal in Prader Willi  patients demonstrates that both syndromes are caused by the same microdeletion of the 15q12 region.<br>
                If the microdeletion is inherited from the mother, the child gets Angelman’s. The same microdeletion inherited from the father results in Prader Willi .<br>

            <b>Methylation</b><br>
                A hallmark of imprinting is that genes are differentially methylated. Methylated genes are inactivated; non methylated genes are expressed.<br>
                The 15q12 region undergoes parental specific imprinting, <br>
                SNORD116 genes are methylated on the mother's homolog, active on the father's homolog.<br> 
                UBE3A is the opposite, active on the mother's homolog, methylated on the father's homolog.<br>
                Additional genes are within the 15q12 region.  OCA2 is an example that is not methylated.<br> 
                When the microdeletion is inherited from the father, deletion of the SNORD116 complex from his homolog prevents expression of his allele. Methylation of the mother's homolog prevents expression of her allele.  Thus, there's no expression of SNORD116.  The result is Prader Willi  syndrome.<br>
                The same deletion from the mother's homolog results in Angelman’s.  In this case UBE3A is not expressed while the SNORD116 cluster is.<br>
                Note, OBA2 is expressed whether the microdeletion occurs with the father's or mother's homolog, although at reduced a level because it is only expressed from one allele. OBA2 induces melanin synthesis, and reduction of its expression is believed to be responsible for the hypopigmentation observed with Angelman’s and Prader Willi syndromes.<br>
                Epigenetics demonstrates that methylation patterns vary between male and female pronuclei, even though they appear identical.<br>
