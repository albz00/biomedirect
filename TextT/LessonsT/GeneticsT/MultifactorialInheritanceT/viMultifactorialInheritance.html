        <p><h3><b>Multifactorial Inheritance</b></h3><br>
            <b>Glossary</b><br>
                Multifactorial Traits, characteristics controlled by multiple factors,  both genetic and environmental.<br>
                Most human traits are determined by multiple genes in conjunction with multiple environmental influences.  Monohybrid traits are the minority.<br>  
                Examples of multifactorial traits include height, weight, IQ, blood pressure, mental disorders, cancers, lupus and multiple sclerosis.<br>
                Polygenic Inheritance, for a trait to be controlled by multiple genes.<br>
                Polygenic inheritance can be thought of as the genetic component of a multifactorial trait.<br>
                Pleiotropy, for a single gene to control multiple traits.<br>
                Polymorphism, two or more alleles for a gene in the population.<br>
                Do not confuse these terms.<br>  
                Polygenic refers to multiple genes, polymorphism to multiple alleles in a population for a single gene.<br>  
                Pleiotropy is the opposite of polygenic, not multiple genes contributing to a trait, but a single gene contributing to multiple traits.<br>  
                An example of pleiotropy is cystic fibrosis.<br>
                Heritability, estimate of how much genetics (as opposed to environment) contributes to a given trait.<br>
                Quantitative Multifactorial Traits, can be assigned a numerical value<br>
                Examples, height, weight, IQ, serum cholesterol, fingerprint ridge count, diastolic blood pressure) <br>
                Qualitative Multifactorial Traits, cannot be assigned a number, either occur or not, all or none phenomena<br>
                Examples, heart attack, stroke, cancer, schizophrenia, manic depression, cleft palate, neural tube defects, pyloric stenosis<br>
                The key is whether a number can be assigned to the trait.<br>

            <b>Normal Distribution</b><br>
                If the 1 to 2 to 1 ratio is plotted on a histogram, with the number of recessive alleles plotted on the X axis, the second bar for the heterozygote will be twice as high as the first and third bars, for the homozygous dominants and homozygous recessives.<br>
                This distribution is reminiscent of a bell shaped curve.<br>  
                If a hexahybrid cross with six loci is plotted in the same manner, it will resemble a bell shaped curve more closely.<br>
                Note, this exercise assumed all the loci are autosomal recessive, but we know that many genes are non Mendelian. However, the principle still applies.  Most individuals inherit a mixture of genes  that balance each other.  A minority of people happen to inherit a  high proportion of genes that push them to an extreme.<br>
                Multifactorial traits distribute into bell shaped curves.<br>
                For instance, when height is plotted on the X axis with the number of individuals at different heights on the Y axis, most people fall near the average, with fewer and fewer taller or shorter people.<br>
                Shown is a photograph from world war 1, demonstrating how height falls into a normal distribution.<br>

            <b>Quantitative Traits versus Qualitative Traits</b><br>
                The previous explanation explained how quantitative traits are usually distributed into bell shaped curves, but what about qualitative traits? <br>
                If the trait cannot be quantified, how can the X axis be plotted? <br>
                It is believed that qualitative traits are still normally distributed with risk, or propensity of manifesting the trait on the X axis.<br>

            <b>Threshold Model</b><br>
                The threshold can be thought of as 100%.  It is the point where the risk is so great the trait will manifest.<br>
                This is a very important concept for medicine.  For instance, when a physician takes a family history he or she is evaluating how close the patient is to the threshold.  If preventive medication or life style changes are prescribed, the physician is trying to push the patient away from the threshold.
                The tail of the curve beyond the threshold is the incidence.  This is number of people who manifest the trait.<br>
