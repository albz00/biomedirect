        <p><h3><b>Practice Pedigree Recognition</b></h3><br>
            A pedigree has more affected males than females <br>
            No Father to Son Transmission <br>
            Transmission from Affected Grandfather to Carrier Mother to Affected Son <br>
            What’s the inheritance pattern? <br>
             X Linked recessive <br><br>

            If the disease is Skipping Generations <br>
            There are Carrier Fathers, who are not affected but do pass the disease to their offspring. <br>
            Affected females are about as frequent as affected males <br>
            No Father to Son Transmission <br>
            What’s the inheritance pattern?<br>
            Autosomal recessive <br><br>

            All Daughters of Affected Fathers are Affected<br>
            No Father to Son Transmission<br>
            Vertical Transmission<br>
            What’s the inheritance pattern?<br>
             X Linked dominant<br><br>

            Affected males about equal to females<br>
            Vertical Transmission<br>
            There is Father to son transmission<br>
            What’s the inheritance pattern?<br>
            Autosomal Dominant<br><br>

            No Pattern<br>
            Affected males about equal to females<br>
            Vertical transmission and Skipping generations<br>
            Father to Son<br>
            Declining Occurrence<br>
            What’s the inheritance pattern?<br>
            Multifactorial<br><br>

            Males about twice as frequent as females<br>
