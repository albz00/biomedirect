            <b>The water matrix</b><br>
                This lesson will explain the structure and function of biological membranes.<br>
                However, before they can be explained, it is necessary to understand the properties of the water they interact with.<br>
                Specifically, this lesson will begin by explaining polar bonds, hydrogen bonds, and the water lattice.<br>  
                Covalent Bond Polarity<br>
                Because both oxygen atoms in the O2 molecule have the same electronegativity, their shared electrons spend an equal amount of time in the orbitals of each atom, and the covalent bonds are nonpolar.<br>
                Because the electronegativity of oxygen is greater than carbon, the shared electrons of carbon dioxide spend more time in oxygen's orbitals, and the covalent bonds are polar.<br>
                Because the shared electrons spend more time around the oxygen atoms, the oxygens have a partial negative charge, while the carbon has a partial positive charge.<br>
                Because hydrogen only has one proton, its electronegativity is extremely low.  Therefore, the shared electrons of water spend much more time in oxygen's orbitals, and very little in the hydrogens'.  This makes the covalent bonds of H2O very polar.<br>
                The extreme polarity of water's bond result in even greater partial charges.<br>
                The elevated partial charges of water produce hydrogen bonds.<br>
                These are non-covalent, electrostatic interactions between a positive hydrogen and negative oxygen.<br>
                Due to the elevated partial charges, they are strong for non-covalent interactions, although not as strong as covalent or ionic bonds.<br>
                Hydrogen bonds do not just occur with oxygen. They also occur when hydrogen is covalently bound to nitrogen and fluorine, whose electronegativity is comparable to oxygen.<br>
                Hydrogen bonds do not only occur between separate molecules (intermolecular) as with water.<br>
                They can also occur between different groups within the same molecule (intramolecular). <br>
                An example is the α-helix of polypeptides.<br>
                If water molecules were randomly oriented relative to each other, the like charges between the positive hydrogens, and between the negative oxygens, would repel each other.<br>
                Shown is a hypothetical depiction of what would happen if water molecules were randomly oriented relative to each other.<br>
                To minimize electrostatic repulsion water molecules arrange themselves into a lattice that minimizes exposure of like charges and maximizes exposure of opposite charges.<br>
                The attraction of oxygens and hydrogens results in hydrogen bonds, which strengthens this lattice.<br>
                An example of the crystalline lattice of water is the diverse shapes of snowflakes.<br>
                Note, although the molecules of liquid water do orient into a lattice, it is not as stable as that of solid ice.<br>
             <b>Hydrocarbon Chain</b><br>
            	Now that we understand the water lattice, we can begin building a biomembrane.<br>
                Hydrocarbons are a major component of biomembranes.<br>
                These are carbon chains with hydrogens bound to each carbon.<br>
                They are non-polar because they only have one charge on their surface, the partial positive charge of their hydrogens.<br>
                Now consider how hydrocarbons affect the water lattice.<br>
                The positive hydrogens of hydrocarbons attract the negative oxygens of water. <br> 
                This forces the lattice to rearrange into layers.<br>
                The lattice resists this conformation because it places the hydrogens and oxygens side by side, which maximizes like charge repulsion.<br>
                Now consider how multiple hydrocarbons interact in the lattice and with each other.<br>
                To minimize exposure to the lattice, hydrocarbons bind each other.<br> 
                Hydrocarbon surfaces in contact with each other do not contact the lattice.<br>
                This is why oil and water don't mix.<br>
                Hydrocarbons are hydrophobic, which is to say they don't dissolve in water.<br>
                Instead, they clump together, thereby minimizing disruption of the water lattice.<br>
                But why don't the positive charges of the hydrogens repel each other?<br>
                The oscillation of electrons across the orbitals of hydrocarbons becomes synchronous. <br>
                This maximizes exposure of electrons and protons of adjacent atoms, which minimizes exposure of like charges.<br>
                Note, by lowering like charge repulsion, van der Waals forces effectively allow the water lattice to "squeeze" the hydrocarbons together.<br>
            <b>Phospholipids</b><br>
            	To continue our construction of a biomembrane, we introduce a major component, the phospholipids.<br>
                The key feature of phospholipids is that they are amphipathic, which is to say they have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.<br>
                The hydrophobic tails are insoluble because they are non-polar.<br>
                The hydrophilic heads dissolve in water because they are polar.<br>
                Note: lipids are any non-polar, hydrophobic compound. <br>
                Phospholipids are one type. Other types include hydrocarbons (oils), fats, waxes and steroids.<br>
                The polar region contains positive and negative charges.<br>
                Polar compounds are hydrophilic, which is to say they dissolve in water.<br>
                Do not confuse plar bonds and polar compounds. The former are covalent bonds between atoms with markedly different electronegativity. The latter are molecules with positive and negatives sites.<br>
                Officially the head of a phospholipid is defined as the phosphate and the end piece. <br>
                However, the glycerol esters also contribute to the polar region.<br>
                As explained previously, tails are non-polar, i.e. the hydrogens on the surface of hydrocarbons all have the same charge, partial positive.<br>
                Non-polar compounds are hydrophobic; i.e. insoluble.<br>
                During synthesis, the tails are added as fatty acids.<br>
                Fatty acids consist of a hydrocarbon chain with a carboxyl group (OCO) at one end.<br>
                With the example shown these are palmitic acid (above), and oleic acid (below).<br>
                Glycerol is the "backbone" of a phospholipid.<br>
                It ties both fatty acids and the end piece.<br>
                Note, although fatty acids have carboxyl groups, when they bind to glycerol the groups become esters.<br>
                The phosphate links the fatty acids and glycerol (diacylglycerol) moiety and an end piece.<br>
                During biosynthesis, phosphate also serves as a reactive substrate.<br>
                The phospholipid is crowned with an "end piece."<br>
                An end piece is a simple polar group.<br>
                There are five head pieces.<br>
                The example shown is choline.<br>
                Five hydroxyl groups are what make inositol polar.<br>
                This is the amino acid, tacked onto the distal end of a phospholipid.<br>
                Not only is glycerol the backbone of phospholipids, it serves as an end piece.<br>
                Ethanolamine has the longest name, but it is actually the shortest of the five end pieces.<br>
            <b>Phospholipids in water</b><br>
            	The lesson will now explain how polar compounds interact with the water matrix.<br>
                The positive hydrogens of water orient towards the negative charges of a polar compound,  while the negative oxygens of water orient towards the positive charges.<br>
                Thus, instead of disrupting the water lattice, polar compounds integrate with it.<br>
                This is why polar compounds are hydrophilic, i.e. dissolve in water.<br>
                The polar region of phospholipids interacts with, and integrates into the lattice.<br>
                The hydrophilic heads align on the surface of the membrane, where they integrate into the lattice.<br>
                The non-polar hydrocarbon tails of phospholipids disrupt the lattice, producing an unfavorable conformation.<br>
                To minimize exposure to the water matrix, the hydrophobic tails align in parallel in the core of a membrane.<br>
                They are held together by van der Waals forces.<br>
                The phospholipids classes are; phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol.<br>
                Each class is defined by a different end piece; serine, choline, ethanolamine, inositol or glycerol.<br>
                Different members within a class are defined by different hydrocarbon tails.<br>
                To minimize exposure to the water matrix, the hydrophobic tails align in parallel, held together by van der Waals forces.<br>
                The hydrophilic heads align on the surface of the membrane, where they integrate into the lattice.<br>
            <b>Assembly of a biomembrane</b><br>
                If phospholipids dispersed randomly in water, their hydrophobic tails would be exposed to the water lattice.<br>
                Lipids coalesce into micelles, with the hydrophilic heads pulled to the surface where they can integrate into the water lattice, and the hydrophobic tails drawn to the core where they are shielded from the lattice.<br>
                Crowding of tails in the cores limits the size of micelles.<br>
                Aligning lipids in parallel eliminates crowding and creates a continuous layer.<br>
                However, a single layer still leaves a hydrophobic surface exposed to the water lattice.<br>
                With the image shown above, this exposed surface is on the bottom.<br>
                Sandwiching two layers together allows the hydrophilic heads to shield the hydrophobic core from the water lattice on both sides of the bilayer.<br>
                A simple bilayer would still have hydrophobic edges exposed to the water lattice.<br>
                Rounding the bilayer into a hollow sphere eliminates the hydrophobic edge to the lattice.<br>
                Vesicles, organelles, and even the plasma membrane itself, all adopt this basic hollow sphere conformation.<br>
            <b>FrameHeading</b><br>
            	Lipids cannot move vertically from one leaflet to the other (flip flop), because the polar head cannot transverse the hydrophobic core.<br>
                Because lipids cannot flip flop, biological membranes are asymmetric, with a different composition of lipids and other amphipathic compounds in each leaflet.<br>
                Although lipids and other amphipathic factors don't flip flop from one leaflet to the other, they do flow horizontally within a leaflet.  This is known as the fluid mosaic model.<br>
                In addition to phospholipids, biomembranes consist as a diversity of amphipathic compounds.<br>
                Of note are transport proteins, transmembrane receptors, antigens and cholesterol.<br>
                These are explained in the Transport Proteins & Intercellular Signaling lessons.<br> 
                Cholesterol is a lipid with a central 4 ring backbone. <br>
                It is a flat compound that inserts into a leaflet, between the phospholipids.<br>
                Cholesterol in amphipathic, with a hydrophilic hydroxyl at one end, that hydrogen bonds with the polar heads, thereby orienting cholesterol in the leaflet.<br>
                Cholesterol serves to maintain biomembrane stability and fluidity.<br>
                It is also the precursor for steroids, bile acids and vitamin D.<br>
                The role of steroids is explained in the Intercellular Signaling Lesson.<br>
                Now let's consider how the structure of the hydrocarbon tails affect biomembrane fluidity.<br>
                Hydrocarbons with no double bonds are homogeneously packed in parallel.<br>
                A double bond in a tail causes it to bend.<br>
                Hydrocarbons without double bonds are saturated because they are bound by the maximum number of hydrogens. Hydrocarbons with double bonds are unsaturated because two hydrogens are lost with double bond formation.<br>
                A bent hydrocarbon disrupts the organization of tails in the bilayer.<br> 
                Now let's see what happens with multiple unsaturated hydrocarbons.<br>
                Unsaturated, bent hydrocarbons do not pack together as tightly.<br>
                This lowers the density of a biomembrane, which increases its fluidity.<br>
                This is also why unsaturated fatty acids have lower freezing points, which explains why plants, who often have to withstand the cold, tend to have greater levels of unsaturated fatty acids.<br> 
                Animals, who can regulate their body temperatures, have higher levels of saturated fats.<br>
                Membrane Permeability<br>
                Hydrophobic compounds readily diffuse through the core of the bilayer.<br>
                They must be dissolved in a lipid matrix, e.g. endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm, or a lipoprotein in the extracellular space.<br>
                Small polar compounds can also transverse a membrane.<br>
                Large compounds cannot t<br>ransverse a membrane.<br>
                This is because they<br> would have to separate the tails as they passed, which would require breaking too many hydrophobic bonds.<br>
                To pass through a membrane, large compounds require either a transport protein, endocytosis or exocytosis.<br>
                Charged, ionic compounds cannot transverse a membrane.<br>
                Cations are repelled by the positive hydrogens of the core.<br>
                Anions are resisted by the van der Waals matrix, because they attract the electrons of the core so strongly, they interfere with their synchronous oscillation.<br>
                Membrane permeability will be explained further in the Transport Protein lesson.<br>
                In addition to the plasma membrane, there is an extensive network of intracellular biomembranes; e.g. endoplasmic reticulum, vesicles, organelles, etc.<br>
                 Plasma Membrane Functions; hold cellular contents, separate the cell from the environment, allow control of movement in and out of the cell (e.g. transport proteins), provide a matrix for cell-to-cell communication (e.g. receptors).<br>
                Intracellular Membrane Functions;  provide a great deal of surface area for biosynthesis (e.g. lipogenesis, RER protein translation), allow compartmentalization of substances and cellular functions (e.g. endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, the nucleus).<br>
