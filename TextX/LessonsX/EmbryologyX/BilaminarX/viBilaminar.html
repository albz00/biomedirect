        <p><h3>The Bilaminar Stage</h3><br>
            <b>Implantation</b><br>
            	During implantation, trophoblast cells adjacent to the underlying inner cell mass attach to the endometrial mucosa.<br>
            <b>Syncytiotrophoblast </b><br>
            	Trophoblast cells expel nuclei to form a syncytium surrounding the implanted blastocyst, known as the syncytiotrophoblast.<br>
            	A syncytium consists of multiple nuclei in a common cytoplasm.<br>
            	The remaining cells of the trophoblast become known as the cytotrophoblast.<br>
            <b>Lamination</b><br>
            	The ICM laminates into two layers, the epiblast and hypoblast.<br>
            	The hypoblast assembles into a single layer of squamous cells.<br>
            	Lateral epiblast cells migrate around the overlying cytotrophoblast, to form a new layer known as the amnion.<br>
            	The amnion is occasionally called the extraembryonic ectoderm.<br>
            	Epiblast cells that remain adjacent to the hypoblast assemble into a single layer of columnar cells.<br>
            	<br>At this stage the epiblast constitutes an oval sheet.
            	<br>The epiblast will develop into the fetus.
            	<br>A fluid filled space forms between the epiblast and amnion.  This space is known as the amniotic cavity.
            	<br>The fetus will grow into the amniotic cavity, which serves to cushion the fetus.
            	<br>Amniocentesis is when a sample of amniotic fluid is extracted, although this procedure cannot be conducted until much later in gestation, 11 weeks at the earliest.
            	<br>The epiblast and hypoblast constitute the bilaminar germ disc.
            	<br>The bilaminar stage refers to this disc.
            <b>Yolk Sac</b> <br>
            	The hypoblast expands around the periphery of the blastocoel to form the extraembryonic endoderm.<br>
            	The extraembryonic endoderm eventually surrounds the blastocoel.<br>
            	The space that used to constitute the blastocoel, along with the extraembryonic endoderm, is now known as the primary yolk sac.<br>
            <b>Extraembryonic Mesoderm</b> <br>
            	Extraembryonic mesoderm differentiates from the extraembryonic endoderm.<br>
            	The extraembryonic mesoderm spreads to create and fill a new space between the yolk sac and amnion, and the cytotrophoblast.<br>
            <b>Lacunae Stage</b> <br>
            	Lacunae form in the extraembryonic mesoderm and syncytiotrophoblast.<br>
            	A lacuna is a fluid filled space within a tissue.<br>
            	This period is often referred to as the lacunar stage.<br>
            	Trophoblastic lacunae are the beginning of placenta formation, which is explained in the Placenta lesson.<br>
            <b>Chorion</b> <br>
            	The lacunae in the extraembryonic mesoderm expand and coalesce to form a new space known as the chorionic cavity, which splits the extraembryonic mesoderm.<br>
            	Splanchnic extraembryonic mesoderm coats the yolk sac.<br>
            	Somatic extraembryonic mesoderm coats the cytotrophoblast & amnion.<br>
            	The chorion consists of three layers, syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast and somatic extraembryonic mesoderm.<br>
            	The connecting stalk is a column of somatic extraembryonic mesoderm that tethers the amnion, yolk sac and germ disc, to the chorion.  It will develop into the umbilical cord<br>
            <b>Secondary Yolk Sac</b> <br>
            	A segment pinches off of the primary yolk sac.  This is the exocoelomic cyst.  The remainder is now known as the secondary yolk sac.<br>
            	Normally, the structure is simply called a yolk sac.<br>
            	It would only be called primary or secondary if it's necessary to distinguish one from the other.<br>
            	Eventually the exocoelomic cyst regresses, leaving the secondary yolk sac.<br>
