    "explain": {
        "a": "The streak elongates and regresses, so the fate of cells invaginating through the cranial end depend on when they invaginate.",
        "b": "The cardiogenic field is derived from the first cells to invaginate through the steak at the caudal end of the trilaminar germ disc, while the  oropharyngeal membrane is at the cranial end.  Cardiogenic invagination doesn’t wait for the prechordal plate to reach the oropharyngeal membrane.",

        "a": "Conotruncal ridge spiraling does not affect blood pressure.  Indeed, if it did it would be detrimental because blood pressure must be maintained so that it can be pushed throughout the lungs and body.",
        "b": "The conotruncal ridges form the conotruncal septum, which does direct venous blood to the lungs.  However, shunting of the blood to the left and right lungs occurs with the pulmonary arteries, which are cranial to the conotruncal septum.",
        "c": "The conotruncal septum that’s produced from the conotruncal ridges is one of the barriers separating the venous and arterial systems.  However, ridge spiraling is not necessary for this separation.",
