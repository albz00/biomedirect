        "a": "Follicular cells are somatic cells that surround primary oocytes to form primordial follicles.",
        "b": "CORRECT: The cells that migrate from the yolk sac to the genital ridge are the primordial germ cells.  These give rise to the germline.",
        "c": "Sertoli cells are somatic cells in the epithelium of a seminiferous tubule.",
        "d": "Somatic cells are everything that isn't produced by the cells in question.",
        "e": "The cells that migrate from the yolk sac to genital ridge are primordial germ cells.  They produce the germline and spermatocytes are part of the germline, so this is a correct answer.  However, it is not the best answer.  Oocytes, spermatogonia, spermatozoa, etc. are all parts of the germline.   The entire germline is produced by the primordial germ cells, so that is a better answer than any individual component."

    "explain": {
        "a": "Maturation is the process by which a spermatid develops into a spermatozoon with a flagella, acrosome, mitochondrial sheath and sloughed cytoplasm.  It occurs after a spermatocyte becomes secondary.",
        "b": "Meiosis is the entire process of reproductive cell division.  However, what the question asked about is a specific intermediate cell type, a secondary spermatocyte.",
        "c": "CORRECT: By definition a primary spermatocyte becomes secondary when it enters meiosis II.",
        "d": "Spermatogenesis is the entire process of differentiation of spermatogonia into spermatozoa.  However, what the question asked about is a specific intermediate cell type, a secondary spermatocyte.",
        "e": "Spermiogenesis is the period of spermatogenesis when maturation occurs.  It occurs after a spermatocyte becomes secondary."

        "b": "Spermatocytes slough their cytoplasm before they reach the epididymis.",
        "c": "CORRECT: As cells progress through spermatogenesis they pass through the seminiferous epithelium, from the side closest to the basement membrane to the lumen.  Sloughing cytoplasm is one of the last things that occurs in the epithelium, before spermatocytes are released into the lumen.",
        "d": "Spermatocytes slough off their cytoplasm before ejaculation, which is when they reach the vas deferens.",
        "e": "Spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous epithelium. The testicular interstitium is the space between the seminiferous tubules."

        "a": "Although fertilization of an ovum does induce completion of meiosis, meiosis actually begins long before.",
        "b": "Meiosis and folliculogenesis both begin about the same time, when the ovary forms in the female fetus.  Follicle maturation is completed during a menstrual cycle, years later.",
        "c": "CORRECT: Gonadogenesis is the best answer.  Oogonia enter meiosis while the ovary is forming in the female fetus.",
        "d": "Although the oocyte is released from prophase I and progresses to metaphase II soon before ovulation, the oocyte began meiosis and became suspended in prophase I long before.",
        "e": "Meiosis commences long before puberty.  By the time a girl reaches puberty her oocytes have been suspended in prophase I for years."

        "a": "Follicles become secondary before the cumulus oophorus extends into the antrum.",
        "b": "CORRECT: The event in question is when the simple cuboidal granulosa cells of a primary follicle proliferate into a compound epithelium.   The relevance of this event is that it is when a follicle becomes committed to undergo maturation.",
        "c": "This is the event in question, but that’s not what was asked.  The question asked for the relevance of this event.",
        "d": "The oocyte is released from prophase I near the end of folliculogenesis, long after the follicle becomes secondary.",
        "e": "The zona pellucida does form as the follicle becomes secondary, but that’s a concurrent event.  It doesn’t explain the relevance."

        "a": "This produces identical twins, not fraternal twins.",
        "b": "This would require an oocyte to survive for a month, which is extremely unlikely.",
        "c": "This is polyspermy, which results in polyploidy.  Polyploidy is 100% fatal to the fetus.",
        "d": "This would interfere with the process of oogenesis, probably resulting in atresia.  However, it would not result in two ova, so it wouldn’t produce twins.",
        "e": "CORRECT: Usually only one ovum ovulates from one ovary per menstrual cycle, but occasionally this mechanism must fail, allowing two ova to ovulate, probably one from each ovary."

        "c": "Endometrial expansion is induced by estrogen secreted by developing follicles.  The structure in question completes expansion; it does not initiate it.",
        "d": "CORRECT: The structure in question is the corpus luteum.  It secretes progesterone which completes and maintains endometrial expansion.",
