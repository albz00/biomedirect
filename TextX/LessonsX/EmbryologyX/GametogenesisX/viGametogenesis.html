        <p><h3><b>Gametogenesis</b></h3><br>
            <b>Primordial Germ Cells</b><br>
                In meroblastic embryos, the stem cell population for the germline comes from Primordial Germ Cells in the proximal yolk sac.<br>
                Evidence suggests that these germline stem cells actually originate in the embryonic mesoderm, are translocated to the yolk sac, then return to the embryo.<br>
                Stem cells in the proximal region of the yolk sac differentiate into primordial germ cells by becoming amoeboid and migrating towards the embryo.<br>
                In the embryo the primordial germ cells reach the genital ridges, which will develop into testicles or ovaries.<br>
                Note, at this point the embryo is in the indifferent stage, before the germline and gonads become distinguishable in males and females.<br>

                <b>Reproductive Tracts</b><br>
                Gametogenesis occurs in the male and female gonads (testes & ovaries).<br>

            <b>Spermatogenesis vs Oogenesis</b><br>
                Primordial Germ Cells differentiate into the precursor cells of the germline.<br>
                These precursors are called spermatogonia in males, oogonia and females.<br>
                Meiosis occurs during gaa me toe genesis.  The purpose is to reduce the ploidy of the germ cells from diploid, 2n, to haploid, 1n.<br>
                This prepares the gametes for fertilization, which reconstitutes diploidy in the next generation.<br>
                Primary gametocytes are in meiosis I<br>
                In males they are known as primary spermatocytes, in females they are primary oocytes.<br>
                Secondary gametocytes are in meiosis II.<br>
                During gametogenesis sperm and eggs adopt opposite strategies for retaining cytoplasm.<br>
                Sperm slough off their cytoplasms.  This makes them streamline, which increases their speed and improves their chance for reaching the egg.<br>
                Eggs maximize their cytoplasm, because before implantation the fallopian tube and uterus provide no nutrients, so an egg must possess enough cytoplasm to support development until the embryo reaches the endometrium.<br>  
                They do so by unequal cytokinesis, producing one daughter cell with most of the cytoplasm.  Polar bodies are the daughter with little cytoplasm.<br>
                Polar bodies are produced during telophase I and II.<br>
                They will eventually be discarded.<br>

            <b>Spermatogenesis</b><br>
                Differentiation of sperm<br>

            <b>Seminiferous Tubules</b><br>
                Spermatogenesis occurs in the epithelium of seminiferous tubules.<br>

            <b>Seminiferous Epithelium</b><br>
                As spermatic germ cells descend through the seminiferous epithelium they progress through spermatogenesis.<br>
                Mature Sper mat o zoa are released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule.<br>

            <b>Seminiferous Flowchart</b><br>
                Spermatogonia are committed to spermatogenesis by incomplete cytokinesis, producing clusters connected by cytoplasmic bridges.<br>
                The n value is the complete genomes per cell, known as the ploidy.  The c value is the number of Chromatids per Chromosome.<br>
                SPERMATOGENESIS, the Entire Process<br>
                SPERMATOGONIA are the Stem Cell Population of spermatocytes.  They Propagate by Mitosis.<br>
                Spermatogonia are diploid, 2n, but they are 4c at the end of each S phase, and return to 2c after each mitosis.<br>
                Spermatocytes are male germ cells that are undergoing meiosis.  They are diploid (2n) at the beginning of prophase 1, haploid (1n) at the end of telophase 2.  This is when the ploidy of each cell is reduced from 2n to 1n.<br>
                PRIMARY SPERMATOCYTES are in Meiosis 1.  They are 4c at the beginning of prophase 1, 2c at the end of telophase 1.<br>
                SECONDARY SPERMATOCYTES are in Meiosis 2.  They are 2c at the beginning of prophase 2, 1c at the end of telophase 2.<br>
                SPERMIOGENESIS is the Period of Maturation.  The secondary spermatocytes are 1n (haploid), and 1c.<br>
                SPERMA TIDS, secondary spermatocytes in SPERMIOGENESIS.<br>
                SPER MAT O ZOA, Mature Sperm, Released Into Lumen<br>

            <b>Sperm Maturation</b><br>
                Maturation entails, Sloughing Off Residual Body, Acrosome formation, Flagellum formation and Packing Mitochondria Around Middle Piece of Flagella.<br>
                RESIDUAL BODIES are Cytoplasms that are Sloughed Off from sperma tids.  These are Resorbed by Sertole Cells.<br>

            <b>Sper mat o zoa</b><br>
                Sperm consist of the Head and flagellum.<br>
                The head is little more than the male nucleus surrounded by plasma membrane.<br>
                It is surrounded by a cap known as the acrosome, which covers the proximal two thirds of the head. The acrosome contains digestive enzymes for degrading the zona pellucida of the egg during fertilization.<br>
                The Postacrosomal Region is the distal region of the head, between the acrosome and base of the flagellum.<br> 
                The flagellum is sub divided into 4 regions.<br>
                The first is the Neck, which is a short stretch between the head and middle piece.<br>
                The Middle Piece is surrounded a sheath Mitochondrial.  The purpose for this concentration of mitochondria is to provide energy to the flagellum.<br>
                The Principal Piece is the longest stretch of the flagellum.<br>
                The End Piece is a short narrowing at the end of the flagellum.<br>
                Note, sperm are relatively inactive until they are capacitated in the female reproductive tract.<br>

            <b>Oogenesis</b><br>
                Differentiation of Eggs<br>
                Folliculogenesis, Development of Follicle <br>
                Folliculogenesis Includes Oogenesis<br>

            <b>Atresia</b><br>
                In females, primordial germ cells differentiate into oogonia after they reach a genital ridge.<br>
                As the genital ridge develops into an embryonic ovary, the oogonia population proliferates by mitosis.<br>
                Primordial follicles are primary oocytes surrounded by follicular cells.<br>
                At the peak, after 5 months of gestation, there are about 7 million primordial follicles.<br>
                After the fifth month many of the primordial follicles undergo a process known as atresia, where they regress into masses of scar tissue.<br>
                By the seventh month only 2 million to 700,000 primordial follicles persist.  Atresia continues after birth, so that by puberty only 400,000 primordial follicles remain.<br>

            <b>Oogenic Flowchart</b><br>
                Do not confuse oocytes and follicles.  Primary oocytes are in primordial follicles, as well as primary and secondary follicles. Secondary oocytes form in graafian follicles.<br>

            <b>Oogenesis</b><br>
                Oogonia become oocytes when they enter meiosis.  Primary oocytes are in meiosis I. Secondary oocytes are in meiosis II.<br>
                In the embryonic ovary oogonia regress by atresia or differentiate into oocytes by initiating meiosis.<br>
                They remain primary oocytes because prophase one halts in diplotene.  Differentiation into secondary oocytes does not commence until after puberty.<br>
                Follicular cells constitute a squamous epithelium, derived from stroma cells that cluster around a primary oocyte.<br>
                Primary follicles develop when the squamous follicular cells swell into cuboidal granulosa cells.<br>
                Primordial follicles are continuously developing into primary follicles from birth to menarche.  However, all primary follicles that develop before puberty regress by atresia.  Indeed, even after puberty most follicles become atretic.  Only one follicle per menstrual cycle will mature and ovulate.<br>
                Stromal cells cluster around the granulosa cells to form a squamous epithelium known as the theca folliculi.<br>    
                Follicles become secondary when their granulosa cells expand from a simple to a compound epithelium.<br>    
                After puberty, during each menstrual cycle, a pool of primary follicles develops to the point where they become responsive to follicle stimulating hormone.  FSH induces granulosa expansion.<br>
                The granulosa cells of secondary follicles deposit a layer of glycoprotein around the primary oocyte known as the zona pellucida.<br>
                The theca folliculi laminates into two epithelial layers, the theca externa and theca interna.<br>
                The theca externa is a layer of connective tissue that surrounds the follicle.<br>
                The theca interna and granulosa cells interact to synthesize and secrete estrogen.<br>
                As the granulosa cells proliferate, a fluid filled space known as the antrum forms within them.<br>
                A few hours before ovulation the oocyte is released from prophase one.  It progresses to metaphase two where it remains unless fertilized.<br>
                A polar body is a daughter that inherits little if any cytoplasm due to unequal cytokinesis.<br>
                The daughter that inherits the cytoplasm is a secondary oocyte.<br>
                Graafian is a descriptive term for a large follicle.<br>
                By the Graafian stage the oocyte projects into the antrum.  This is surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells known as the cumulus oophorus.<br>  
                Only one follicle per cycle advances to this point.  All others regress at different stages.<br>
                During ovulation the secondary oocyte along with the cumulus oophorus erupts from the surface of the ovary.  This mass will be drawn into the Fallopian tube by the fimbriae and cilia of the tube’s infundibulum.<br>
                After ovulation the secondary oocyte is also called an ovum or egg cell. It is surrounded by the zona pellucida, which is surrounded by the granulosa cells of the corona radiata.  These are the same cells that formed the cumulus oophorus in the Graafian follicle.<br>
                The granulosa and thecal cells that remain in the ovary after ovulation form the corpus luteum.<br>
                In the corpus luteum, granulosa cells become known as luteal cells, and theca interna cells become thecal luteal cells.<br>
                Theca luteal cells synthesize progesterone and the Androstenedione.<br>
                Luteal cells convert Androstenedione into estrogen.<br>
                The theca externa is a connective tissue layer.<br>
                Progesterone induces the endometrium of the uterus to reach full expansion, and maintains the endometrium during the first few months of pregnancy.<br>
                If the egg is not fertilized no blastocyst forms to implant in the endometrium, and the corpus luteum regresses into a mass of scar tissue known as the corpus albicans.<br>

            <b>Menstrual Cycle</b><br>
                Hormones control synchronous development of follicles and endometrium.<br>
                If a blastocyst implants it secretes human chorionic gonadotropin which stabilizes the corpus luteum so that it will continue to secrete progesterone and maintain the endometrium for pregnancy.<br>
