        <p><h3><b>Gestational Overview</b></h3><br>
        <b>Description of Demonstration</b><br>
            This lesson is a continuously running video of the process of human gestation, from ovulation to the pre-term neonate.<br>
        <b>Here is a list of the main events and structure that are depicted.</b><br>
            Ovulation<br>
            Fertilization<br>
            First Division of the zygote<br>
            Cleavages to the 8-cell morula<br>
            Compaction<br>
            Blastocyst with blastocoel, inner Cell Mass and Trophoblast<br>
            Hatching<br>
            Implantation<br>
            Syncytiotrophoblast and Cytotrophoblast<br> 
            Lamination of inner cell mass into epiblast and hypoblast<br>
            Amnion expansion around the upper blastocoel to form the amniotic cavity<br>
            Expansion of hypoblast around lower blastocoel to form the extraembryonic endoderm around the primary yolk sac<br>
            Differentiation of the extraembryonic mesoderm from the extraembryonic endoderm, between the cytotrophoblast and extraembryonic endoderm.<br>
            Formation of extraembryonic lacunae in the extraembryonic mesoderm and trophoblastic lacunae within the syncytiotrophoblast<br>
            Expansion of and coalescence of extraembryonic lacunae to form the chorionic cavity<br>
            The chorion consisting of syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast and somatic extraembryonic mesoderm, <br>
            The connecting stalk connecting the embryo and chorion.<br>
            Segregation of exocoelomic cyst from primary yolk sac, leaving the secondary yolk sac.<br>
            Morphogenesis of epiblast into trilaminar embryo.<br>
            Chorionic villi formation within chorion<br>
            Expansion of embryonic circulatory system within embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm.<br>
            Heart formation<br>
            Morphogenesis of the embryo into  the fetus with a head, face and limbs<br>
            Expansion of embryo and chorionic villi, with the embryo growing into the amniotic cavity and the villi remaining attached to the endometrium to for the placenta.<br>
