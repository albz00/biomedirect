    "explain": {
        "a": "Vertebrae develop from somites, which are derived from paraxial mesoderm.  The paraxial mesoderm is in the center of the mesoderm, near the notochord.  However, the arrow points to intermediate mesoderm.",
        "b": "CORRECT: The arrow points to the intermediate mesoderm, which is between the paraxial mesoderm in the center of the germ disc, and lateral mesoderm near the ends.  Intermediate mesoderm does develop into much of the urogenital system, and kidneys are part of that system.",
        "c": "Fallopian tubes do develop from intermediate mesoderm, which is where the arrow is placed.  However, the arrow points to the right side, so it is unlikely the teratogen would affect the left tube.",
        "d": "The spinal cord is an ectodermal tissue derived from the neural tube.  The arrow points to mesoderm.",
        "e": "The abdominal wall is derived from the lateral mesoderm, which is on the sides of the germ disc, where the disc connects to the amnion and yolk sac.  However, the arrow points to the intermediate mesoderm."

    "question": "After the medial ventral region of a somite dissociates, the remainder of that somite is laser ablated.  What tissues would fail to form?",

        "a": "a rib at the level of the somite",

    "correctAns": [
        "d"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "The medial ventral region that dissociates from the somite is known as a sclerotome.  Sclerotomes develop into vertebrae, and in the thoracic region vertebrae produce ribs.  Therefore, if this region was not ablated, there are no grounds for predicting that a corresponding rib would not develop.",
        "b": "The medial ventral region that dissociates from the somite is known as a sclerotome.  Sclerotomes develop into vertebrae, so if this region was not ablated, there are no grounds for predicting that the corresponding vertebra would not develop.",
        "c": "A dorsal lateral region that does not dissociate from its somite at this time is a dermomyotome.  These do develop into muscles and dermis.  However, only one dermomyotome was ablated, so only one set of muscles and dermis should be affected, not the entire thorax.  Moreover, the level of the somite was not specified, so it could affect the neck or abdomen, as well as the thorax.",
        "d": "CORRECT: The dorsal lateral region that does not dissociate from the somite at this time is the dermomyotome.  If this were ablated, it could not produce muscles and dermis at the level of the somite.",

        "a": "A fibia is a leg bone.  The bones of the legs and arms are derived from lateral mesoderm, not somites.",
        "b": "Kidneys are derived from lateral mesoderm, not the paraxial mesoderm of somites.",
        "c": "The latissimus muscle is derived from a dermatome, which does form from a somite.  However, this muscle is in the lumbar level, so its somite forms halfway through somitogenesis, not at the end.",
        "d": "CORRECT: Somite formation proceeds in the cranial to caudal direction, so the last pair of somites are at the tip of the tail.  However, most of the tail regresses in apes, so destroying the last pair of somites just eliminates a structure that would wane anyways.",
        "e": "Somite formation proceeds in the cranial to caudal direction.  The first cervical vertebra (atlas) is at the cranial end of the vertebral column, so it is one of the earliest somites to form, not the last."

    "answers": {
        "a": "The grooves are rotated ventrally until they meet and fuse to form the cavity.",
        "b": "Lacunae form and coalesce to form the cavity.",
        "c": "The medial portions of somites dissociate to form the cavity between the lateral and paraxial mesoderms.",
        "d": "The ventral endoderm invaginates to form the cavity.",
        "e": "The ventral wall of each groove surrounds the gut; the dorsal wall coats the periphery of the cavity."

        "a"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "CORRECT: The grooves do rotate and fuse as the embryo folds ventrally.",
        "b": "This describes how the grooves originally form within the lateral mesoderm, not how they develop into the body cavity.",
        "c": "The medial portions of somites do dissociate, but this process produces sclerotomes, not the body cavity.  Moreover, these cells are part of the paraxial mesoderm, while the central body cavity is surrounded by lateral mesoderm.",
        "d": "Endodermal invagination best describes gut formation, not the body cavity.",
        "e": "This statement is accurate, but explains the distribution of the coelomic tissues, not formation of the body cavity."
