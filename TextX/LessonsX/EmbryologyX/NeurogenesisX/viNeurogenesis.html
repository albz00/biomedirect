        <p><h3><b>Neurogenesis</b></h3><br>
            <b> Neurulation</b><br>
                Initial Formation of the Central Nervous System<br>

            <b> Invagination</b><br>
                The cells of the medial ectoderm become columnar to form the neural plate.  Growth factors from the notochord will control development of the neural tube's floor plate (not shown).<br>
                The neural plate folds upwards.  The walls are known as neural folds, the groove is the furrow, and the crests are the junctions between the neural folds and the remaining ectoderm.<br>
                The neural folds eventually converge and fuse along the dorsal mid line, forming a hollow cylinder known as the neural tube.<br>  
                The tube is the precursor of the central nervous system, brain as well as spinal cord.<br>
                The neural tube constitutes a substantial proportion of the early embryo.<br>
                The notochord is actually very small, but it is very important as the organizer controlling neurulation.<br>

            <b> Neural Tube</b><br>
                The neural plate is wider towards the cranial end.  This widening is committed to differentiate into brain.  The caudal end of the plate will differentiate into spinal cord.<br>
                The edges of the infolding plate eventually join and fuse to form the cylindrical neural tube.  The fusion begins in the region that will eventually develop into the neck.<br>
                As the embryo elongates fusion of the neural tube progresses.  The pores that persist at the ends of the tube are known as the cranial and caudal neuropores.<br>
                The neuropores eventually close.<br>
                The cranial region of the neural tube differentiates into three brain vesicles;  prose, mees, rhomb en cephalon, which are synonymous terms for forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain respectively.<br>

            <b> Cerebral Expansion</b><br>
                Growth of the central nervous system is during this early period is disproportionate to the rest of the embryo.<br>
                The Prosen cephalon of the Fifteen Somite Embryo produces the Telen cephalon and Die en cephalon of the Forty Somite Embryo<br>
                The Telen cephalon produces the Cerebrum of the Adult.<br>
                The Die en cephalon produces the Thalamus and Hypothalamus of the adult.<br> 
                The Mees en cephalon of the Fifteen to Forty Somite Embryo produces the Midbrain of the adult.<br>  The Rhomben cephalon of the Fifteen Somite Embryo produce the Met en cephalon and Myelen cephalon of the Forty Somite Embryo.<br>
                The Met en cephalon produces the Cerebellum and Pons of the Adult.<br>
                The Myel en cephalon produces the Medulla of the Adult.<br>

            <b> Neural Crest Cells</b><br>
                Now let's consider the neural crests, which are the margins between the invaginating neural tube and the remaining ectoderm.<br>
                Neural crest cells separate from the neural crests and migrate throughout the embryonic mesoderm.  Neural crest cells are a mees en chymal stem cell population that differentiates into numerous cell types and structures such as Schwann cells, melanocytes, ganglia, cranial nerves and conotruncal heart cushions.<br>
                Neural crest cells migrate through the mesoderm by one of two routes, either the dorsolateral path adjacent to the ectoderm, or the medial path adjacent to the neural tube.<br>
