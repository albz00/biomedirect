        "a"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "CORRECT: Anterior designates the body surface that’s forward when an animal moves.  Ventral designates the side of the belly.  Primates walk with their bellies forward, so their ventral side is anterior.  The head of most animals is forward when they move, so for them anterior is cranial.",
        "b": "Coronal designates the plane that divides the body into dorsal and ventral halves.",
        "c": "Dorsal designates the backside, which is opposite to the ventral side.",
        "d": "The medial plane divides the body into left and right halves.",
        "e": "Proximal designates the end of a structure that is closer to its base and closer to the midline of the body.",
        "f": "Sagittal divides the body into left and right parts.  The medial plane is a sagittal plane that is positioned along the midline of the body.  Most sagittal planes are offset to the left or right."

    "question": "A disturbed man commits suicide by jumping in front of a train.  When emergency personnel investigate the scene, they discover that the man’s body was cut in two along his abdomen.  The inferior half of his body was found beside the tracks, but they had to search for the superior half because it was thrown into a patch of woods thirty feet away.  The poor man’s body was severed along which plane?",

    "correctAns": [
        "d"

    "explain": {
        "a": "If the man’s body were severed along the coronal plane, his belly and chest would have been separated from his back.",
        "b": "If the man’s body were severed along the medial plane, his left side would have been separated from his right side.",
        "c": "If the man’s body were severed along a sagittal plane, then one of his sides, left or right, would have been larger than the other.",
        "d": "CORRECT: The transverse plane divides the body into top and bottom halves, which is how this man’s body was severed.",
        "e": "Ventral designates the side of the body with the belly, not a plane."

    "question": "Which of the following terms defines the spatial relationship of a lung to its bronchus?",

        "a", "b"
    ],
    "explain": {
        "a": "CORRECT: A lung is at the end of its bronchus, so it is distal to the bronchus.",
        "b": "CORRECT: A lung is positioned towards a side of the body, while a bronchus is closer to the midline, so a lung is lateral to its bronchus.",
        "c": "Posterior would mean that a lung is behind its bronchus, the side towards the back, which is not the case.  A medial side of a lung is attached to its bronchus.",
        "d": "Rostral would mean that a bronchus attaches to the top of the lung, towards the nose, which is not the case.  A bronchus attaches to the medial side of its lung.",
        "e": "Transverse designates the plane that divides the body into top and bottom.  It does not define the spatial relationship of one structure to another."
