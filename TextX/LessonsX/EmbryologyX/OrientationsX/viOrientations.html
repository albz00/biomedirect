        <p><h3><b>Orientations</b></h3><br>
            <b>Body Axes</b><br>
                Four axes are used to designate the spatial orientation of structures of the body.<br>
                Ventral means towards the belly.<br>
                Dorsal is towards the back.<br>
                Anterior is the front, in explanation, the forward direction of movement, the direction that the animal walks, swims or flies towards.<br>  
                Because primates walk on two legs, they move in the direction of their belly, and their anterior is synonymous to ventral.<br>
                Most animals move towards their head, with their belly horizontal to the ground, so anterior is usually synonymous to cranial.<br>
                Posterior is the rear.  In primates it is synonymous to dorsal; in most animals it  is synonymous to caudal.<br>
                Lateral is towards the left or right sides of the body.<br>
                Medial is towards the midline.<br>
                Cranial is towards the head.<br>
                Caudal is towards, or below, the rump.<br>
                Superior is synonymous with cranial.<br>
                Rostral is towards the nose.  During early embryogenesis this is synonymous with cranial.<br>
                Inferior is synonymous to caudal.<br>
                Proximal is towards to the base of a structure.  For appendages this is towards the midline of the body.<br>
                Distal is towards to the end of a structure.  For appendages this is away from the midline of the body.<br>

            <b>Body Planes</b><br>
                Four hypothetical planes are used to define cross sections through the body.<br>
                A coronal plane divides the body into dorsal, ventral parts.<br>
                A transverse plane divides the body into caudal, cranial parts.<br>
                Transverse planes are also known as horizontal planes.<br>
                A sagittal plane divides the body into left, right parts.<br>
                Sagittal planes are also known as longitudinal planes.<br>
                The medial plane is the central sagittal plane, that divides the body along the midline.<br>
