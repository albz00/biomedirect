        <p><h3><b>Placental Morphogenesis</b></h3><br>
            <b>Trophoblastic Lacunae</b><br>
                The trophoblastic lacunae that form in the syncytiotrophoblast during the bilaminar stage constitute the origin of the maternal component of the placenta.<br>

            <b>Maternal Sinusoids</b><br>
                As the lacunae expand they coalesce with endometrial capillaries to form blood filled spaces known as maternal sinusoids.<br>

            <b>Angioblast Differentiation</b><br>
                The embryonic circulatory system forms by vasculogenesis at numerous sites throughout the embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderms.<br>
                Vasculogenesis is the initial differentiation of clusters of mesodermal stem cells into blood vessels.<br>
                The clusters differentiate into angioblasts at scattered sites throughout both the extraembryonic and embryonic mesoderms.<br>
                Angioblasts are stem cells for the circulatory system.<br>
                The angioblasts of each cluster will differentiate further into endothelial or primitive blood cells.<br>
                Note, it is currently under debate whether the same angioblasts differentiate into either endothelial or primitive blood cells, or whether different types of angioblasts produce these two cell types.<br>
                After the vessels form, the embryonic circulatory system will expand by angiogenesis, which is extension and branching of preexisting vessels.<br>
                Primitive blood cells are distinguished from adult erythrocytes by possession of nuclei and expression of embryonic hemoglobin.<br>

            <b>Chorionic Villi</b><br>
                As endometrial capillaries and glands invade the chorion they fuse with trophoblastic lacunae to form blood filled cavities known as maternal sinusoids.<br>
                Columns of cytotrophoblast known as chorionic villi extend through the syncytiotrophoblast.<br>
                When chorionic villi extend through the syncytiotrophoblast and reach the endometrium, their cytotrophoblast cells spread out between the two layers.<br>
                The chorionic villi form branches as they extend through the syncytiotrophoblast.<br>
                Extraembryonic mesoderm eventually grows into the villi.<br>
                Capillaries develop in the mesodermal cores by angiogenesis.<br>
                Villi that extend through the chorion to the outer trophoblast shell are known as stem villi.<br>
                Branches are terminal villi.<br>
                The cytotrophoblast cells eventually surround the syncytiotrophoblast to form the outer trophoblast shell.<br>
                The maternal sinusoids expand and coalesce to form a continuous lumen between the villi known as the intervillous space.<br>
                Chorionic villi constitute the basic structure of placental tissue, and they establish its function.  Fetal blood flows through the capillaries of the villi, while maternal blood flows through the intervillous space.  Oxygen, nutrients and fetal waste products diffuse across the villi walls without allowing fetal and maternal blood to intermix.   This prevents isoimmunization, which would lead to rejection of the genetically foreign fetal tissue by the mother's immune system.<br>
                In addition to stem and terminal villi, chorionic villi are classified based on the composition of their cores.<br>
                Primary villi only have the Cytotrophoblast Core within the Syncytiotrophoblast Sheath.<br>
                Secondary villi have a Mesodermal Core Within the Cytotrophoblast.<br>
                Tertiary villi have Capillaries Within the Mesodermal core<br>
                Note, by month 4 the cytotrophoblast will regress from most villi. It only persists in large stem villi that do not participate in exchange between the circulatory systems.  Exchange occurs across terminal, tertiary villi.<br>

            <b>The Placental Shell</b><br>
                A shell forms in the chorion around the embryo.<br>
                Maternal sinusoids expand and coalesce to form the intervillous space.<br>
                Embryonic capillaries proliferate by vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.<br>
                Villi proliferate to allow exchange between the embryonic and maternal circulatory systems.<br>

            <b>Placenta</b><br>
                As the embryo grows into uterine cavity, chorionic villi remain attached to endometrium where they develop into the placenta.<br>
