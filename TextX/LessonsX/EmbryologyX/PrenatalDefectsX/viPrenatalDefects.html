        <p><h3><b>Prenatal Defects</b></h3><br>
            <b>Glossary</b><br>
                Mutation are anomalies resulting from a change in DNA sequence<br>
                Teratogenesis is the non mutagenic development of a birth defect.  Greek Etymology, Teratos, Monster, Gignesthai, To Be Born<br>
                Teratogen is a factor promoting teratogenesis<br>
                Teratogenic is a non mutagenic property of causing birth defects<br>
                Teratology is the study of teratogenesis<br> 
                Teratogens interfere with a developmental process, but they do not mutate DNA.  Therefore, teratogenic defects are not heritable.<br>
                Congenital, present at birth<br>
                Birth Defect, also known as a Congenital Anomaly, a morphologic, behavioral or and metabolic abnormality present at birth.<br>
                Malformation, a morphological anomaly, <br>
                Deformation, structures that never form correctly, malformed from the beginning.  Example given, malformed cranium due to oligohydramnios<br>
                Disruption is when a normal structure becomes malformed.  Example given, amputation due to amniotic band constriction<br>
                Syndrome are anomalies occurring together due to a common etiology.  Example given, Fetal Valproate Syndrome.  The etiology is fetal exposure to valproic acid.  Anomalies include: heat flow, telecanthus, short nose, small mouth, long fingers.<br>
                Association is anomalies with no known common etiology, occurring together more frequently than would be predicted by random chance.  Example given, VAC TER L Association; vertebral, imperforate anus, cardiac, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal and limb anomalies<br>

            <b>Common Prenatal Defects</b><br>
                Ectopic Pregnancy, a blastocyst implanted outside the uterus, most often in the Fallopian tube<br>
                Hydatidiform Mole, intrauterine mass derived from a malformed blastocyst with little to no fetal tissue, and grapelike chorionic villi.  Etiology, polyploidy or unipaternal diploidy<br>
                Blighted Ovum, a gestational sac devoid of an embryo, multiple etiologies<br>
                Placenta Previa, implantation near the internal os, resulting in placenta cervical overbridging and maternal hemorrhage<br>
                Abruptio Placentae, detachment of the placenta from the wall of the uterus<br>
                Confined Placenta Mosaicism, a placenta and fetus with different genetic makeups<br>
                Cord Abnormalities, umbilical cord defects, example given single umbilical artery, cord knots, nuchal cords<br>
                Oligohydramnios, low amniotic fluid volume<br>
                Polyhydramnios (hydramnios), excessive amniotic fluid volume<br>
                Cystic Hygroma, lymph filled sac, usually in the head and neck region, produced by lymphatic blockage<br>
                Genetic Defects, self-explanatory<br>
                Erythroblastosis Fetalis, hemolytic anemia due to isoimmunization, example given if blood from a Rh positive fetus gets into the circulatory system of a Rh negative mother <br>
                Osteogenesis Imperfecta, genetic defects resulting in brittle bones<br>
                Hydrocephaly, buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in cerebral ventricles due insufficient drainage.  Causes include aqueductal stenosis between the third and fourth ventricles, neural tube defects, central nervous system infections, brain tumors and head trauma.<br>
                Heart Defects, self explanatory<br>
                Neural Tube Defects, failure of the neural tube to close, resulting in spina bifida or anencephaly<br>
                Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, congenital defect due to exposure to ethanol during gestation.  Symptoms include intellectual disability and holoprosencephaly<br>
                Cranial Facial Defects, self explanatory<br>
                Limb Abnormalities, self explanatory<br>
                Diaphragmatic Hernia, hole in the diaphragm<br>
                Intestinal Abnormalities, self explanatory<br>
                Renal Abnormalities, self explanatory<br>
                Ambiguous Genitalia, external genitalia with male and female features<br>
                Teratomas, a tumor consisting of a heterogeneous composite of different tissues<br>
                Sacrococcygeal Teratoma, a teratoma at the base of the coccyx, derived from persistent primitive streak tissue<br>
                Caudal Dysgenesis, underdevelopment of caudal structures (pelvis, legs and or feet), due premature regression of the primitive streak<br>
                Vanishing Twin, one twin is resorbed<br>
                Twin Transfusion Syndrome, monochorionic twins receive unequal amounts of blood from their shared placenta<br>
                Conjoined Twins, physically joined twins<br>
                Monochorionic Pregnancy, both twins within one chorionic cavity.  They can be dizygotic or monozygotic, and they will share the placenta.<br>
                Monoamniotic Pregnancy, both twins within one amniotic cavity.  They will be monozygotic, the amnion will be within the same chorionic cavity, and they will share the placenta.<br>

            <b>Ectopic Pregnancies</b><br>
                Typically, the blastocyst implants on a lateral wall of the body of the uterus.<br>
                Implantations at the apex of the fundus also support healthy pregnancies.<br>
                Ectopic means in the wrong place.<br>  
                Placenta previa results from Implantation near the internal os, producing placenta cervical overbridging and maternal hemorrhage.<br>
                The most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is the ampulla of the Fallopian tube.<br>
                Tubal pregnancies must be terminated because the growing fetus cannot survive in the confines of the Fallopian tube, and there is a substantial risk of maternal fatality due to the tube rupturing.<br>
                Methotrexate is the most common, and least traumatic method for terminating an ectopic pregnancy.<br>  
                The infundibulum is not fused to the ovary, and the ovum is drawn into the Fallopian tube by sweeping motions of the fimbriae.<br>
                Occasionally a fertilized egg escapes the fimbriae and is released into the abdominal cavity.<br>  
                An ovarian pregnancy is when a blastocyst implants onto the surface of an ovary.<br>
                If a blastocyst implants in the abdominal cavity it is known as an abdominal pregnancy.<br>  
                The most common site for abdominal pregnancies is the rectouterine pouch.<br>

            <b>Hydatidiform Moles</b><br>
                The embryoblast of a triploid blastocyst is underdeveloped, and little to no fetal tissue develops.<br>
                Extraembryonic tissue does develop from the trophoblast, forming edematous, "grape like," chorionic villi.<br>
                Two Types of Hydatidiform Moles, Partial, Triploidy, Complete, Paternal Diploidy, in explanation both genomes from father<br>
                Three Fates for Moles<br>
                Spontaneous Abortion, most likely, often before pregnancy detected<br>
                Expansion of the mole, possibly to fill the uterus<br>
                Choriocarcinoma, trophoblastic cells invade endometrium, can become metastatic, 10 to 20% mortality with treatment<br>
                Three Fates for Triploids<br>
                Spontaneous Abortion<br>
                Partial Hydatidiform Mole<br>
                To Term, 100% neonatal mortality, malformed<br>

            <b>Sacrococcygeal Teratoma</b><br>
                Produced If the Primitive Streak Fails to Regress Completely<br>
                Teratomas are tumors consisting of cell types from different tissues.<br>
                Primitive streak cells are stem cells for the entire endoderm and mesoderm, and so sacrococcygeal teratomas are composed of a mixture of cell types.<br>
                Before birth sacrococcygeal teratomas can deprive the fetal brain of blood.  After birth they can be removed surgically.<br>  

            <b>Caudal Dysgenesis</b><br>
                Underdevelopment of caudal structures due to premature regression of the primitive streak, before it deposits enough mesoderm in the caudal end of the germ disc.<br>
                Caudal dysgenesis takes many forms, from clubbed feet to sirenomelia, where the legs are fused.<br>
                The mortality of sirenomelia is extremely high due to fusion of the urinary system.<br>
                Only a handful of subjects have survived.<br>
                One surviving case is Milagros Cerron, a Peruvian girl whose legs were separated by Dr. Luis Rubio in 2005 and 2006.<br>
                Many mythological creatures are believed to have been inspired by birth defects, example give mermaids who are reminiscent of sirenomelia.<br>

            <b>Holoprosencephaly</b><br>
                Failure of Brain to Divide into Left & Right Hemispheres<br>
                Four Types, Listed from Most to Least Severe<br>
                Alobar, Complete fusion, plus third & lateral ventricles, almost normal looking faces, only occurs with ZIC2 mutation<br>
                Semi Lobar, Frontal and parietal lobes fused<br>
                Lobar, Frontal cortex fused<br>
                Middle Interhemispheric Variant, Middle fused<br>
                Central Facial Defects<br>
                Cephalothorax, Fusion involving cardiac region, less common<br>
                High Pre & Postnatal Mortality <br>
                Intellectual Disability<br>
                Note fusion of cerebral hemispheres and hypotelorism.<br>
                Multiple mutations and teratogens can cause holoprosencephaly.<br>
                Two noteworthy causes are trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) and ethanol (fetal alcohol syndrome).<br>
                Facial Defects<br>
                Cyclopia, single eye<br>
                Hypotelorism, closely spaced eyes<br>
                Anophthalmia, eyes absent<br>
                Microphthalmia, small eye<br>
                Narrow and/or depressed nose<br>
                Proboscis, tubular shaped nose<br>
                Cleft palate and lip (median or bilateral) <br>
                Ethmocephaly, microphthalmia, hypotelorism, proboscis, no nose<br>
                Almost normal looking face (can occur with lobar and Middle Interhemispheric Variant) <br>
                Other symptoms<br>
                Prenatal or postnatal mortality (most alobar die within 6 months) <br>
                Seizures<br>
                Neural tube defects<br>
                Hydrocephalus<br>
                Pituitary dysfunction<br>
                Instability of temperature, heart rate, and respiration<br>
                Feeding difficulties<br>
                Developmental delay<br>
                Short stature<br>
                Intellectual disability<br>
                Severity of symptoms varies, with less severe symptoms tending to occur with lower degrees of cerebral fusion (lobar & middle interhemispheric variant).<br>

            <b>Neural Tube Defects</b><br>
                Severity Dependent on Degree of Dysraphism and Position Along Spinal Column<br>
                Most Occur in Lumbar Region<br>
                Failure of tube to close results in dysraphism, failure of spinal processes to fuse.<br>
                Spina bifida occulta is dysraphism without meninge out pouching.<br>
                Occulta is generally the least severe type of spina bifida.<br>
                Presenting Symptom, Overlying Blemish, Patch of Hair, Mole, Dimple, etc.<br>
                Meningocele, Meninges Out Pouch Through Dysraphism<br>
                Generally Moderate Severity<br>
                Myelomeningocele, Meninges and Neural Tissue Out Pouch Through Dysraphism<br>
                Generally Most Severe<br>
                Anencephaly, Due to Closure Failure in Cranial Region of Neural Tube, 100% Neonatal Mortality<br>
                Neural Tube Defect Marker? Elevated α Fetoprotein, Detects open Defects, not Spina Bifida Occulta<br>
                This is a fetal liver protein.  It is released through open defects such as meningomyelocele and gastroschisis. Spina bifida occulta is not an open defect and it does not result in elevated AFP.<br>
                What Inhibits Neural Tube Defects? Folic Acid<br>
                The mechanism for folic acid protection is unknown.  Flour, rice, pasta and cornmeal are now supplemented with folic acid, although the levels are insufficient to meet the minimal requirements.<br>

            <b>Twins</b><br>
                Twinning is Teratogenic, Incidence of birth defects is increased with twins.<br> 
                Prenatal mortality is 5 to 10 times higher with twins.<br>
                Vanishing Twin Syndrome, it is estimated that 71% of the time one twin perishes during gestation, so only one infant is born.<br>

                <b>Twin Transfusion Syndrome</b><br>
                This results when one fetus of a monochorionic pregnancy receives a disproportionate proportion of blood from the placenta.  This can develop quickly.  Embolisms threaten the life of both fetuses.<br>

                <b>Fetus Papyraceus</b><br>
                This results when one fetus regresses into a mummy like mass.  This threatens both fetuses.<br>

            <b>Conjoined Twins</b><br>
                Conjoined twins occur when two embryos do not separate completely, or when separate embryos fuse together.<br>
                Classified by where they are joined.<br>
                Cephalopagus, fused heads<br>
                Thoracopagus, fused chests<br>
                Cephalothoracopagus, fused heads and chests<br>
                Pygopagus, fused rumps<br>
                Thoracopygopagus, fused chests and rumps, i.e. two heads, one body<br>
                Parasitic conjoined twins, one incompletely formed.<br>  
                Conjoined twins often share internal organs.<br>

            <b>Monochorionic/Amniotic Twins</b><br>
                Dizygotic twins arise when two separate oocytes are fertilized.<br>
                Before implantation, dizygotic blastocysts develop independently.<br>
                Dizygotic pregnancies usually develop separate membranes.<br>
                When dizygotic blastocysts implant close to each other, their placentas and chorions fuse (monochorionic).<br>
                Monozygotic twins arise when an early embryo splits in two.<br>
                If the embryo splits during the morula stage it will behave like a dizygotic embryo.<br>
                The membranes are usually separate, but if they implant close together they will become monochorionic with fused placentas and chorions.<br>
                If the inner cell mass splits only one trophoblast will develop, so they will be monochorionic.<br>
                If the epiblast splits, the fetuses will share the same placenta, chorion and amniotic cavity, and they will be monoamniotic.<br>

            <b>Normal Placenta Function</b><br>
                Metabolites are exchanged but fetal blood cells do not enter the maternal system, and maternal blood cells do not enter the fetus.<br>

            <b>Rh Isoimmunization</b><br>
                Bleeding occurs when the placenta separates from the uterine wall during birth.<br>
                Some fetal cells from the bleeding placenta can enter the maternal system.<br>
                If the mother is Rh negative and the fetus is Rh positive, then the mother's immune system will recognize the fetal erythrocytes (red blood cells) as foreign.<br>
                Isoimmunization (also called alloimmunization) is to be immunized by antigens from another individual of the same species.<br>
                Rh positive fetal RBCs are destroyed in the maternal spleen.  In the process the mother's immune system produces Rh antibodies.<br>  
                The mother's immune system will continue to produce Rh antibodies long after the fetal RBCs are cleared from the maternal system.<br>  
                Basically, the Rh negative mother is inoculated against Rh antigens.  The mother is said to be sensitized.<br>

            <b>Second Pregnancy</b><br>
                The problem arises during a subsequent pregnancy. The mother's Rh antibodies will cross the placenta and enter the fetus.<br>
                The mother's Rh antibodies bind antigens on the surface of Rh positive, fetal R B Cs.  Fetal organs such as the liver and spleen then destroy these tagged erythrocytes.<br>
                Erythroblastosis Fetalis, also known as Hemolytic disease of the fetus or newborn, is fetal Anemia produced by excessive destruction of fetal RBCs, due to isoimmunization.<br>
                Hydrops Fetalis, Extreme cases of erythroblastosis fetalis, characterized by edema and fetal demise.<br>
                A fetus with hemolytic anemia can be treated with intrauterine transfusion of packed RBCs.<br>

            <b>Rho Gam</b><br>
                To explain how Rh isoimmunization is prevented, consider a woman who has not been sensitized and doesn’t have any Rh antibodies are circulating in her system.<br>
                Placenta abruptio is another way fetal blood can get into the maternal system.<br>
                Rho GAM is administered to avoid isoimmunization.  This consists of Rho D antibodies.  Rho D is the most common allele of the Rh antigen.<br>
                The Rho GAM antibodies bind the fetal RBCs so they can be cleared by the mother's spleen before her immune system produces its own antibodies.<br>
                Thus, Rho GAM prevents sensitization, thereby protecting future pregnancies.<br>
                Rho GAM is routinely administered to Rh negative mothers with Rh positive fathers at 28 weeks, and again after delivery.  However, it will also be given anytime there is suspicion of placental bleeding, such as a miscarriage, vaginal bleeding, or abdominal trauma.<br>
                Rho GAM serves to prevent sensitization.  After a woman becomes sensitized, there is no longer any benefit.  For instance, if a Rh negative mother delivers a Rh positive baby without receiving Rho GAM, there will be no point administering it with any subsequent pregnancies.<br>         </p>
