        <p><h3><b>Skeletogenesis</b></h3><br>
            <b>Osteogenesis Histology</b><br>
                Osteogenic Cell Types will be listed, then their Description and Function, finally what they are produce by and what they differentiate into.<br>
                Mees en chyme, Any Loosely Organized Population of Undifferentiated Cells, the come from Lateral and Paraxial Mesoderm, and Neural Crest Ectoderm, and differentiate into Chondroblasts, Osteoblasts and Osteoclasts<br>
                Chondroblasts, Produces Cartilage Secretes Collagen X, they come from Mees en chyme and differentiate into Chondrocytes.<br>
                Chondrocytes, Cartilage Cells, the come from Chondroblasts, and they are Terminally Differentiated<br>
                Osteoblasts, Deposits Bone Secretes, Collagen 1 & Calcium phosphate, they come from Mees en chyme and differentiate into Osteocytes.<br>
                Osteocytes, Bone Cells, they come from Osteoblasts, and they are Terminally Differentiated.<br>
                Osteoclasts, Resorbs Bone for Remodeling, they come from Mees en chyme, and they are Terminally Differentiated<br>
                There are two Modes of Bone Formation, Intramembranous Ossification and Endochondral Ossification.<br>
                With Intramembranous Ossification, a mees en chymal Sheath differentiates directly into bone.<br> 
                Bones formed by this process are sometimes referred to as Dermal or membranous Bones.<br>
                Half the skull as well as the clavicle is formed by this process.<br>
                Many bones form from paraxial mesoderm at the cranial End of the embryo by this process, example given the parietal bone of skull<br>
                Bones at the cranial end of the embryo also form from Neural Crest Ectoderm by this Intramembranous Ossification, example given facial bones, squamous, temporal, clavicle.<br>
                With Endochondral Ossification a Mees en chyme model forms.  A Chondrification center appears and spreads throughout the model, converting mees en chyme into a cartilaginous model. An Ossification center then appears and spreads, converting cartilaginous model into bone.<br>
                Endochondral ossification forms the bones of the body and half of the cranial bones.<br>
                From the Paraxial Mesoderm the occiput, vertebrae and ribs all develop by this process.<br>
                intervertebral discs also develop from paraxial mesoderm by this process, although in their case the cartilaginous models don’t ossify.<br>
                The Lateral Mesoderm Mostly forms the Appendicular Skeleton by this process.  Examples include the long bones (limbs), girdles, sternum, basilar occiput & petrous temporal bone.<br>
                The Neural Crest Cells develop into Bones and Cartilages of Face and Neck this way.<br>

            <b>Axial Skeleton</b><br>
                Spinal Column, Rib Cage, Dorsal Skull<br>
                The majority of the axial skeleton (vertebral column, ribs, occiput) is derived from sclerotomes.<br>
                Mees en chymal sclerotome cells dissociate from their somites and assemble around the spinal cord and notochord.<br>
                Each of these clusters will develop into a vertebra.<br>

            <b>Resegmentation</b><br>
                The mees en chyme is less dense at the cranial end of each sclerotome.<br>
                A separation forms between the dense caudal end, and less dense cranial end of each sclerotome.<br>
                The cranial and caudal ends of each sclerotome separate and fuse with the ends of adjacent sclerotomes.<br>
                These separations occur at the level of rami.<br>
                Thus, rami will protrude from the future spinal column at the level of intervertebral discs.<br>
                Notochordal tissue within each intervertebral disc persists and develops into a gelatinous center known as a nucleus pulposus.<br>
                A fibrous ring, known as an annulus fibrosus, develops around each nucleus pulposus.<br>
                The rest of the mees en chyme of each intervertebral disc develops into cartilage.<br>
                This is an example of chondrification without ossification.<br>
                Within each vertebra the notochord degenerates by apoptosis.<br>

            <b>Sclerotome Designation</b><br>
                After resegmentation, the caudal half of each sclerotome is redesignated, making it the cranial half of the next vertebra.<br>
                For instance, the caudal half of sclerotome T2 becomes the cranial half of vertebra T3.<br>
                Note there are eight cervical sclerotomes and cervical nerves, but only seven cervical vertebrae.<br>
                This is because the cranial half of sclerotome C1 contributes to the occiput, and the caudal half of sclerotome C8 forms the cranial half of vertebra T1.<br>

            <b>Vertebra</b><br>
                Vertebrae form by endochondral ossification.<br>
                Sclerotomes constitute the mees en chymal models.<br>
                Chondrification centers form within the model as mees en chymal cells differentiate into chondroblasts.  These secrete cartilaginous components such as collagen.<br>
                Chondrification centers expand to completely convert the mees en chymal model into a cartilaginous model.<br>
                Primary ossification centers form within the cartilaginous model as blood born cells invade and differentiate into osteoblasts. These secrete components of bone such as Calcium phosphate.<br>
                Ossification centers expand to completely convert the cartilaginous models into bony vertebrae.<br>
                The last region of a vertebra to ossify is the spinous process.<br>
                Spina bifida is when spinous processes fail to close.<br>
                Secondary chondrification and ossification centers develop after birth.  These serve to continue growth and remodeling of the vertebrae.  By adulthood these completely ossify and vertebral growth ceases.<br>
                The main distinction between vertebrae involves the fate of the costal processes of their mees en chymal models, which do not persist in ossified vertebrae.<br>
                With cervical and lumbar vertebrae costal processes fuse with transverse processes.  Thus, the transverse process of one of these ossified vertebrae is derived from the costal and transverse process of its mees en chymal model.<br>
                With a cervical vertebra the transverse process arches around the transverse foramen.<br>
                With a thoracic vertebra the costal processes extend and develop into ribs.<br>
                Five vertebrae fuse to form the sacrum.  The costal and transverse processes form lateral crests and sacral tuberosities.<br>
                The coccyx forms when 8 to 10 of the caudal most vertebrae regress and fuse to form the 3 to 5 bones of the tailbone.<br>

            <b>Ribs</b><br>
                Rib development begins with extension of mees en chymal costal processes.<br>  
                Chondrification centers appear in the middle of the extending ribs.<br>
                Ossification centers appear in the middle of cartilaginous ribs.<br>
                Each transverse process remains connected to its vertebra.<br>
                A joint develops separating the head of the rib from the transverse process.<br>
                The transverse process develops a facet for attachment with the head of the rib.<br>
                As ribs extend around the developing thoracic cavity, ossification expands to produce bony ribs.<br>

            <b>Sternum</b><br>
                The sternum develops from lateral plate mesoderm by endochondral ossification.<br>  
                Two mees en chymal, sternal bands condense in the ventrolateral wall of the embryo.<br>
                Cranial to the bands, mees en chymal presternum and suprasternums will contribute to the manubrium of the sternum.<br>
                Ribs and the sternum develop as the embryo folds to form the coelom.<br>
                Clavicles develop from neural crest cells by intramembranous ossification.<br>
                The sternal bands, presternum and suprasternums all fuse at the ventral side of the closing thoracic coelom.<br>  
                Sternal fusion is coincident with chondrification.<br>
                Clavicles are one of the first bones to ossify.<br>
                They are the only example of intramembranous ossification outside of the cranium.<br>
                As with any bone that develops by endochondral ossification, ossification centers expand within the sternal cartilaginous model, and then ossification centers expand within the sternal cartilaginous model.<br>

            <b>Lateral Skull Morphogenesis</b><br>
                The different bones of the skull will develop from neural crest ectoderm, paraxial and lateral mesoderm.<br>
                Cranial neural crest cells are supplied as mees en chyme that has spreads around the periphery of the embryonic head. Many of these condense into the pharyngeal arches where they form cartilaginous cores.<br>
                More cranial bones are derived from the first pharyngeal arch than the other four combined.<br>  
                The first pharyngeal arch is bilobed, with maxillary and mandibular Prominences.<br>
                The two lobes separate, dividing its core in the process.<br>
                The core in the maxillary Prominence becomes known as the palatoquadrate cartilage.  Meckel's cartilage is the core of the mandibular Prominence; Reichert's cartilage is the core of arch 2.<br>
                Although these cores will eventually degenerate, they serve as nucleation centers around which neural crest mees en chyme develops into cranial bones, as well as laryngeal cartilages.<br>  
                The paraxial mesoderm that forms the occiput is derived from the first four sclerotomes, and the cranial half of the first cervical sclerotome.<br>
                In addition to sclerotomes and pharyngeal arches, neural crest and lateral mesoderm cells condense to form additional mees en chymal models.<br>
                The periotic capsule will develop into the petrous part of the temporal bone.<br>
                The parachordal cartilage will develop into the basilar part of the occiput bone.<br>
                Five mees en chymal models develop around the palatoquadrate cartilage of the maxillary Prominence.<br>
                These models are primordia for the nasal bone, maxilla, zygomatic bone, sphenoid, and squamous part of the temporal bone, including the zygomatic process of the temporal bone.<br>
                The model for the mandible develops around Meckel's cartilage.<br>
                The malleus and incus also bud from Meckel's cartilage.<br>
                Reichert cartilage elongates and develops the stapes and styloid process, as well as the lesser cornu and superior body of the hyoid bone.<br>
                Reichert cartilage regresses into the stylohyoid ligament.<br>
                The third pharyngeal arch develops the greater cornu and inferior body of the hyoid bone.<br>
                The model for the frontal bone develops from neural crest mees en chyme.<br>
                The model for the parietal bone develops from paraxial mesoderm.<br>
                The forth & sixth arches develop into five cartilages of the larynx; the thyroid, cricoid, corniculate, arytenoid, and cuneiform cartilages.  These cartilaginous models never ossify.<br>
                The epiglottis, the sixth cartilage of the larynx, is derived from the hypobranchial eminence of arches three and four.<br>
                With the exception of laryngeal cartilages, the mees en chymal models all develop into bone, either by intramembranous or endochondral ossification.<br>
                The bones of the skull are categorized by several criteria.<br>
                The first are two functional groups; the Viscerocranium and Neurocranium<br>
                The Viscerocranium composes the Face. The bones are the Incus, Hyoid, Nasal, Maxilla, Stapes, Malleus, Mandible, Zygomatic, Styloid Process, Laryngeal Cartilages, and Zygomatic Process of the Temporal bone.<br>
                The Neurocranium composes of the Braincase, Calvaria and Cranial Vault.  The bones are the Frontal, Parietal, Occiput, Temporal, Sphenoid and Ethmoid.<br>
                Another categorization of cranial bones is their derivation, from the Neural Crest Ectoderm, Paraxial Mesoderm or Lateral Mesoderm.<br> 
                The bones derived from Neural Crest Ectoderm are the Frontal, Nasal, Maxilla, Mandible, Zygomatic, Sphenoid, Ethmoid, Styloid Process, Squamous Temporal, Laryngeal Cartilage, Thyroid, Cricoid, Corniculate, Arytenoid, Cuneiform, Malleus, Incus and Stapes.<br>
                The bones derived from Sclerotomes of the Paraxial Mesoderm are the Parietal, Interparietal Occiput, Squamous Occiput and Occipital Condyles.<br>
                The Petrous Temporal and Basilar Part of Occiput are derived from the Lateral Mesoderm.<br>
                Thus, the anterior part of the skull, in explanation the face, is derived from neural crest ectoderm, the posterior from paraxial mesoderm, with two lateral mesoderm derivatives are between the two.<br>
                A third criteria for classifying cranial bones is their mode of formation, Intramembranous Ossification or Endochondral Ossification.<br>
                The bones of the Membranous Cranium that form by Intramembranous Ossification are the       Parietal, Frontal, Nasal, Maxilla, Mandible, Zygomatic, Squamous Temporal and Interparietal Occiput.<br>
                The bones of the Cartilaginous Cranium that form by Endochondral Ossification are the Occiput (Not Interparietal Part), the Petrous Temporal, Styloid Process, Sphenoid, Hyoid, Ethmoid, Malleus, Stapes and Incus.<br>  
                The Laryngeal Cartilaginous Models also form from Endochondral models, although they never ossify.  These cartilages are the Thyroid, Cricoid, Corniculate Arytenoid and the Cuneiform.<br>
                Cranial bones can also be categorized based on the derivation and their mode of formation.  This scheme designates five groups, Neural Crest Membranous bones, Paraxial Membranous bones, Paraxial Cartilaginous bones, Lateral Cartilaginous bones and Neural Crest Cartilaginous bones.<br>
                The Neural Crest Membranous bones are the Frontal, Nasal, mandible, Maxilla, Zygomatic, Ethmoid, Squamous and Temporal bones.<br>
                The Neural Crest Cartilaginous bones are the Sphenoid, Malleus, Incus, Stapes, Styloid Process, Stylohyoid Ligament, Hyoid and Laryngeal Cartilages.<br>
                The Paraxial Membranous bones are the Parietal and Interparietal Occiput.<br>
                The Paraxial Cartilaginous bones are the Squamous Occiput, Occipital Condyles and Vertebral Column.<br>
                The Lateral Cartilaginous bones are the Basilar Part of Occiput and Petrous Temporal.<br>
                A final scheme for categorizing cranial bones is based on their functional groups and mode of formation.<br>
                This scheme divides the skull into four groups, the Membranous Neurocranium, Cartilaginous Neurocranium Chondrocranium, Membranous Viscerocranium and Cartilaginous Viscerocranium<br>
                The Membranous Neurocranium consists of the Squamous Temporal, Interparietal Occiput, Parietal and Frontal bones.<br>
                The Cartilaginous Neurocranium, also known as the Chondrocranium, consists of the Ethmoid, Sphenoid, Petrous Temporal and Occiput (not the Interparietal part).<br>
                The Membranous Viscerocranium consists of the Nasal, Maxilla, Mandible and Zygomatic.<br>
                The Cartilaginous Viscerocranium consists of the Laryngeal Cartilages, Styloid Process, Malleus, Stapes, Incus and Hyoid bones.<br>

            <b>Skull, Base</b><br>
                Most of the bones at the base of the braincase form by endochondral ossification.  These constitute the chondrocranium.<br>
                Seven mees en chymal models condense and chondrify into cartilaginous models.<br>
                These models are primordia for the chondrocranium.<br>
                The Prechordal cartilaginous model, with is also known as the trabeculae cranii, will form the Ethmoid bone.<br>
                The Periotic Capsule model will form the Petrous Temporal bone.<br>
                The Hypophysial model will form the Sphenoid Body bone.<br>
                The Ala Orbitalis model will form the Sphenoid Lesser Wing.<br> 
                The Ala Temporalis model will form the Sphenoid Greater Wing.<br> 
                The Parachordal model will form the Basilar Occiput.<br> 
                The superior Sclerotomes will form the Squamous Occiput and Condyles. These first cervical sclerotome are the four occipital sclerotomes.<br>
                As these primordial cartilaginous models expand they fuse into the chondrocranium, which begins as a continuous sheet at the base of the embryonic head.<br>
                The cartilaginous models all ossify and fuse to form the bony base of the braincase.<br>
                The bones of the chondrocranium are the Ethmoid, Sphenoid, Lesser Wing, Sphenoid Body, Sphenoid Greater Wing, Petrous Temporal, basal Occiput, Lateral Occipital Condyles and Squamous Occiput.<br>
                Mees en chymal models for membranous bones expand from above the chondrocranium. These will form the Membranous Neurocranium, which consists of the Frontal Bone, Parietal Bone, Squamous Temporal Bone and Interparietal Occiput.<br>
                There are two parietal and two temporal bones, one on each side of the skull.<br>
                The sphenoid, temporal and occipital bones are each a composite of fused parts, each part produced by a different model.<br>
                The front of the skull is derived from neural crest ectoderm, the back from paraxial mesoderm, with two types of bone derived from lateral mesoderm between the two.<br>
                At the front of the skull The Ethmoid, Frontal, Sphenoid and Squamous Temporal Bones are derived from Neural Crest ectodermal cells.<br>
                At the back of the skull The Parietal, Lateral Occipital Condyles, Squamous Occiput and Interparietal Occiput are all derived from Lateral Mesoderm.<br>
                Between the neural crest and lateral mesodermal bones, are the Paraxial Mesoderm Petrous Temporal Bone and Basilar Occiput, which are derived from Paraxial Mesoderm.<br>

            <b>Skull, Crown</b><br>
                The Crown of Skull consists of the Frontal bone, Parietal Bone and Interparietal Occiput.<br>
                Junctions between the bones of the braincase are known as sutures.  Junctions between three or more sutures are fontanelles.  At birth these junctions consist of loose fibrous tissue.<br>
                The Lambdoid Suture is between the Interparietal Occiput and Parietal Bones.<br>  
                The Sagittal Suture is between left and right Parietal Bones.<br>  
                The Posterior Fontanelle is the junction between the Lambdoid and Sagittal Sutures<br>
                The Coronal Sutures are between the Parietal and frontal Bones.<br>
                The Frontal Suture is between the left and right frontal bones.<br>
                The Anterior Fontanelle is the junction between the Coronal and Frontal Sutures.<br>
                There are also anterolateral and posterolateral fontanelles both sides of the head.<br>
                During birth the newborn head must be compressed to pass through the birth canal.  This compression is known as molding.<br>
                Molding entails flattening the frontal bones, overlapping the parietal bones, and drawing out the occiput.<br>
                Molding is facilitated by loose sutures and fontanelles, as well as the softness of newborn bones.<br>
                After birth the braincase rapidly increases in size for two years.  It increases at a slower rate for another fourteen years, and stops all growth after four more years, about age 20.<br>
                The posterior and anterolateral fontanelles close by three months after birth, while the anterior and posterolateral fontanelles close during the second year.<br>
                Several sutures do not close until adulthood.<br>

            <b>Appendicular Skeleton</b><br>
                Arms and Legs comprise the Appendicular Skeleton <br>

            <b>Limb Bud</b><br>
                Limb development begins with buds forming on the surface of the somite stage embryo.<br>
                The first step is thickening of ectodermal tissue at the distal tip of the bud.  This thickening is known as the apical ectodermal ridge, abbreviated AER.<br>
                The bud grows as lateral mesoderm mees en chyme migrates into, and proliferates within, the bud.<br>  
                Mees en chyme migration is induced by, and occurs behind, the AER.<br>  
                Forelimb buds appear before hindlimb buds.<br>
                Forelimb buds will develop into arms, hindlimbs into legs.<br>
                Hand and foot development begin when the distal ends of the elongating limbs flatten into hand and feet plates.<br>

            <b>Limb Bones</b><br>
                Limb bones are derived from lateral mesoderm.<br>
                Limb bones develop by endochondral ossification, which begins with condensation of mees en chymal models, followed by differentiation of primary chondrification centers within the models.<br>
                Primary ossification centers form within the cartilaginous model for each bone.<br>
                Limb development occurs in the proximal to distal direction, so that in the arm the first bone to completely ossify is the humerus; digits are last.<br>
                Digits development is initiated when tissue between digit rays degenerates by apoptosis.<br>

            <b>Long Bones</b><br>
                Endochondral ossification begins when mees en chyme condenses, to form a mees en chymal model.<br>
                Primary chondrification centers form within these mees en chymal models.<br>  
                Mees en chymal cells enlarge and differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes.<br>
                The chondrocytes secrete cartilaginous factors such as collagen type X.<br>
                The perichondrium is a fibrous sheath that forms around the developing bone.  This ossifies to form the bony periosteum.<br>
                Blood vessels invade to nourish the developing bone, as well as deliver osteoblasts and osteoclasts to the cartilaginous model.<br>
                These stem cells constitute the primary ossification center of the developing bone.<br>
                Secondary ossification centers form within the epiphyses.<br>  
                Osteoblasts secrete Calcium phosphate & collagen type I, converting the cartilaginous model into ossified bone.<br> 
                After ossification the osteoblasts are left embedded in the bony matrix, where they differentiate into osteocytes.  Osteoclasts function to resorb bone for remodeling.  The chondrocytes die in the mineralized bone.<br>  
                The diaphysis is the shaft of a long bone; epiphyses are the bulbous ends.  Epiphysial cartilage plates persist between the diaphysis and each epiphysis.<br>   
                The epiphysial cartilage plates are also known as growth plates because they are responsible for bone elongation.  They persist until about age 20, when they ossify and elongation ceases.<br>  
                The medullary cavity forms trabecular (spongy) bone.  Within this cavity cells delivered from the blood differentiate into hematopoietic cells, which produce bone marrow.  The periosteal sheath around the shaft forms cortical (compact) bone.<br>

            <b>Synovial Joints</b><br>
                The last topic of the lesson will be development of synovial joints within long bones.<br>
                The location of a joint is defined when mees en chyme in the middle of a model differentiates into fibroblastic connective tissue.  This region is known as an interzone.<br>  
                Note, fibrous joints such as those connecting the cranium, and cartilaginous joints that connect pelvic bones, also develop from interzones.  However, fibrous joints remain dense fibrous tissue, while cartilaginous joints consist of fibrocartilage.<br>
                The interzone laminates into three layers, articular cartilage, meniscus, and an intervening layer of dense connective tissue. The cartilage of the meniscus, and the articular cartilage, will both serve to cushion the joint as well as reduce friction.<br>
                Vacuoles form in the intervening connective tissue due to cell death.<br>
                The vacuoles coalesce to form the synovial cavity.  The joint capsule lines the cavity.  Joint ligaments  develop from persistent intervening connective tissue.<br>
