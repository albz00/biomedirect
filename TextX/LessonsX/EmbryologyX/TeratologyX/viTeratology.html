        <p><h3><b>Teratology</b></h3><br>
            <b>Glossary</b><br>
                A Birth Defect, also known as a Congenital Anomaly, is a morphologic, behavior or metabolic abnormality that occurs at birth.<br>
                A Mutation is any change in DNA sequence, sometimes resulting in an anomaly.<br>
                Teratogens interfere with a developmental process, but they do not mutate DNA. Therefore, teratogenic defects are not heritable.<br>
                Teratogenesis is the non mutagenic development of a birth defect.<br>
                A Teratogen is a factor that promotes teratogenesis.<br>
                Teratogenic is the property of causing a birth defect.<br>
                Teratology is the study of teratogenesis.<br>
                The word teratogenesis is derived from the Greek word Teratos, which means monster, and Gignesthai which means To Be Born or to form.  Thus, the word teratogenesis means monster forming.  This is inaccurate and socially insensitive because children with birth defects are not monsters and should not be thought of as such.<br>

            <b>Five Principles of Teratology</b><br>
                Teratogens are Specific.  They act on specific molecular and or cellular targets, and they induce specific developmental defects.<br>
                The congenital Anomalies produced by teratogenesis can be morphological, metabolic or behavioral.<br>
                Susceptibility to specific teratogens is influenced by fetal and maternal genetics.<br>
                The severity of a defect is dose and duration dependent.<br>
                Susceptibility to different teratogens varies with gestational age.<br>
                These five principles can be summarized as follows; Specific teratogens interfere with specific developmental processes occurring at specific times.<br>

            <b>Susceptibility Periods</b><br>
                Embryos are susceptible to certain defects during specific periods.<br>
                These defects correspond to developmental events occurring during these periods.<br>  
                On the average the most susceptible period is 3 to 8 weeks.<br>

            <b>Categorization of the Teratogen Information Services, abbreviated T E R I S.</b><br>
                Category A are factors that have been demonstrated to be safe in pregnant women, example given H2O.<br>
                Category B are factors that have been demonstrated to be safe in animals, but are not safe in humans or have not been evaluated in humans.<br>
                Category C have not been evaluated in humans but either teratogenesis has been demonstrated in animals, or have not been evaluated in animals.<br>
                Category D are teratogenic in humans, but benefits may exceed risks in some cases.<br>
                Category X are teratogenic in humans and should never be administered to pregnant women, or women who may become pregnant.<br>
                Substances in category A can be given to any pregnant woman.<br>
                Category X should never be given to a pregnant woman, or women who may become pregnant.<br>
                For substances in categories B, C or D risks & benefits must be considered before prescribing.<br>

            <b>Commonly Known Teratogens</b><br>
                Not all teratogens are chemicals.<br>  
                Anything that’s not mutagenic, but interferes with development is a teratogen.<br>
                Examples of drugs and chemicals that are teratogenic include Thalidomide, Methotrexate, Alcohol, Lead, Mercury, Cocaine, Opiates, Lithium, Benzodiazepines commonly known as valium, Anticonvulsants known as dilantin, ACE inhibitors, Warfarin, Antithyroid agents, a source of Retinoic Acid such as accutane, Vitamin A, Streptomycin, Tetracycline and Gentamycin.<br>
                Teratogenic hormones include Diethylstilbestrol which is a synthetic estrogen and Androgens.<br>
                Physical teratogenic agents include Hyperthermia and Ionizing Radiation such as X rays.<br>
                Teratogenic infectious agents include Toxoplasmosis from cats, Treponema pallidum which causes Syphilis, Rubella which causes German measles, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex and H I V.<br>
                Maternal physiology and metabolism can also be teratogenic.  Examples are Diabetes, Malnutrition, Phenylketonuria, Hypertension and Twinning.<br>
                Thalidomide is a historic example.<br>
                When administered to pregnant women, the offspring can have phocomelia (underdeveloped long bones), heart defects, absence of external ears and malformed intestines.<br>
                In Europe during the 1950s it was prescribed to pregnant women as a sedative, resulting in approximately 7,000 malformed births.<br>  
                This historic tragedy was a major factor advancing the field of teratology, as well as the power of the F D A.<br>
