        <p><h3><b>The Trilaminar Stage</b></h3><br>
            <b>Gastrulation</b><br>
                The Primitive Streak is how Vertebrates Gastrulate<br>
                Gastrulation is the first major cell migration, establishing the germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm.<br>

            <b>Primitive Streak Elongation</b><br>
                About day 13, the primitive streak begins at the caudal end of the bilaminar germ disc.<br>  
                The disc is known as the trilaminar germ disc because the streak is forming the three germ layers, endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm.<br>
                The streak will elongate to approximately two thirds the length of the germ disc.<br>
                Hensen's Node is a Bulge at the Cranial End of the Streak.<br>
                Primitive Ridges are Elevations on Each Side of the Streak.<br>
                Primitive Pit is a Hole in the Center of the Node.<br>
                Primitive Groove is a Furrow Down the Middle of the Streak, between the ridges and Continuous with the pit.<br>
                By the end of week 4 the streak completely disappears.<br>

            <b>Invagination</b><br>
                To understand the relevance of the primitive streak, consider the streak progressing through a transverse section through the germ disc.<br>
                The epiblast invaginates through the medial region of the germ disc to form the primitive streak.<br>
                Epiblast cells that ingress through the early streak insert into the hypoblast, where they differentiate into endoderm.<br>
                As the endoderm proliferates it pushes the hypoblast into the extraembryonic endoderm of the yolk sac.<br>
                The endoderm will completely supplant the hypoblast by pushing it into the extraembryonic endoderm of the yolk sac.<br>
                Epiblast cells that continue to ingress through the primitive streak dissociate as mesenchymal cells.<br>  
                These spread between the epiblast and endoderm, throughout the germ disc.<br>
                The epiblast that fails to invaginate through the streak constitutes the ectoderm.<br>
                All cells that are deposited between the ectoderm and endoderm constitute the mesoderm.  These include the mesenchyme and notochord, which will be described later in this lesson.<br>

            <b>Layer Continuity</b><br>
                Remember that the germ disc is suspended between the amniotic cavity and yolk sac.<br>
                The extraembryonic mesoderm gets its name because it's continuous with the embryonic mesoderm of the trilaminar germ disc.<br>
                Extraembryonic endoderm is continuous with the embryonic endoderm.<br>
                The amnion is occasionally called extraembryonic ectoderm because it is continuous with the embryonic ectoderm.<br>

            <b>Hensen's Node</b><br>
                The cells that ingress through Hensen's node do not dissociate.  Instead they form a hollow tube of contiguous cells known as the notochordal process.<br>
                Epiblast cells that ingress through a primitive ridge dissociate and spread between the epiblast  and endoderm as mesenchymal mesoderm.<br>   

            <b>Epiblast Migration</b><br>
                Neurulation commences while the streak elongates.<br>
                Elongation ceases and regression commences when the streak reaches approximately two thirds the length of the germ disc.<br>
                As the primitive streak regresses, epiblast cells continue to migrate to and through it.<br>
                Epiblast cells that ingress through the streak constitute the mesoderm (& endoderm).<br>
                Epiblast cells that do not reach the streak, and therefore do not invaginate through it, become known as ectoderm.<br>
                Ectoderm will produce the neural tube and epidermis.<br>
                From the dorsal surface somites are visible as mesodermal bulges.  These are covered by ectoderm.
                Somites will be explained in the Mesoderm lesson.<br>

            <b>Endoderm & Mesoderm Deposition</b><br>
                The first epiblast cells to ingress through the primitive streak insert into the underlying hypoblast.<br>
                These cells constitute the endoderm.<br>
                The endoderm expands, eventually pushing the hypoblast into the yolk sac.<br> 
                Before long the cells that invaginate through the streak start to dissociate to form mesenchymal mesoderm.<br>  
                The endoderm at the base of the germ disc, and the mesoderm between the endoderm and epiblast, continue to spread throughout the germ disc.<br>
                The primitive streak begins at the caudal end so the cells of the early streak invaginate at this end.<br>  However as more cells invaginate they push these early cells in the cranial direction.<br>
                The mesenchyme is also pushed in the lateral and cranial directions, forcing the germ disc to adopt a "pear" shape.<br>
                Because the cranial mesoderm is a couple of weeks older than the caudal mesoderm, development of many features will tend to begin in the cranial region, and progress in the caudal direction.<br>
                Note, some mesenchymal mesoderm will be pushed out into the extraembryonic mesoderm.<br>
                Eventually the endoderm completely supplants the hypoblast by pushing it into the yolk sac.<br>
                Primitive streak regression commences when the notochordal primordium reaches the oropharyngeal membrane.<br>
                The oropharyngeal membrane is an area of fusion between the hypoblast and ectoderm.<br>
                It will eventually degenerate to create to oral opening of the digestive tract.<br>
                Note, due to this tight juxtaposition, mesodermal cells cannot migrate between the two layers of this membrane.<br>
                As the primitive streak regresses mesodermal cells continue to dissociate and spread throughout the germ disc.<br>
                The epiblast that fails to invaginate through the streak constitutes the ectoderm.<br>
                The mesenchyme and notochord between the ectoderm and endoderm constitute the mesoderm.<br>
                A Sacrococcygeal Teratoma is Produced If the Primitive Streak Fails to Regress Completely.<br>
                Teratomas are tumors consisting of cell types from different tissues.<br>
                Primitive streak cells are stem cells for the entire endoderm and mesoderm, and so sacrococcygeal teratomas are composed of a mixture of cell types.<br>
                Before birth sacrococcygeal teratomas can deprive the fetal brain of blood.  After birth they can be removed surgically.<br>  
                Caudal Dysgenesis results with the primitive streak regresses prematurely.<br> 
                This is underdevelopment of caudal structures, because too little mesoderm is deposited at the caudal end of the embryo.<br>
                Caudal dysgenesis takes many forms, from clubbed feet to sirenomelia, where the legs are fused.<br>
                The mortality of sirenomelia is extremely high due to fusion of the urinary system.<br>  
                Only a handful of sirenomelia patients have survived.<br>  
                Situs inversus is a developmental defect where the left right orientation of internal organs is reversed.<br> 
                Hensen's node serves as an organizer, secreting growth factors that control left right symmetry of organs.<br>
                Situs inversus results from a disruption of mechanisms controlling left right symmetry.  These mechanisms may involve organizers like Hensen’s node.<br>
                Complete situs inversus is when the orientation of all internal organs is reversed. Partial situs inversus is when the orientation of some organs is reversed, while other organs are in the correct orientation.<br>
                Complete situs inversus has no symptoms because the organs fit together in the thoracic and abdominal cavities.  Partial situs inversus can have serious complications because organs in the wrong orientation do not fit with organs in the normal orientation.<br>

            <b>The Notochord</b><br>
                The notochord is derived by extension of Hensen's Node<br>
                As with Hensen's Node, the notochord serves as an organizer, secreting morphogens to control development of adjacent tissues.<br>
                The epiblast cells that ingress through Hensen's node do not dissociate. Instead, they form a hollow tube of contiguous cells known as the notochordal process.<br>
                This is reminiscence of toothpaste squeezed out of a tube.<br>
                Epiblast cells that ingress through the primitive ridges dissociate and spread between the epiblast and endoderm as mesenchymal mesoderm.<br>   
                The mesenchyme and notochordal process constitute the mesoderm (everything between the epiblast and endoderm).<br>
                The prechordal plate is translocated ahead of the notochordal process.<br>
                As the process elongates it fuses with the endoderm to form the notochordal plate.<br>
                A possible function for this fusion is that as the endoderm expands cranially, it pulls the attached plate along with it.  This guarantees the notochord will extend the length of the germ disc.<br>  
                As the primitive streak regresses, it continues to leave the elongating notochordal plate behind itself.<br>
                The notochordal process soon fuses with the endoderm.<br>
                Because this causes it to flatten, the region of fusion is known as the notochordal plate.<br>
                Fusion opens the ventral surface of the notochordal plate to the yolk sac.<br>
                Because after fusion the notochordal canal becomes an open channel between the amniotic cavity and yolk sac, it is often referred to as the neurenteric canal.<br>
                The neurenteric canal allows diffusion between the amniotic cavity and yolk sac.<br>
                An additional function of the neurenteric canal may be to allow equilibration of pressure between the amniotic cavity and yolk sac.<br>
                The plate becomes the solid notochord when it detaches from the endoderm.<br>
                Detachment will proceed in the caudal to cranial direction.  The endoderm is resealed in the process.<br>
                The notochord remains after the primitive streak regresses.<br>
                The prechordal plate forms immediately ahead of the streak.<br>
                The cells of the prechordal plate are the first invaginate through the streak and insert into the hypoblast, so by definition they are endoderm.<br>
                The hollow notochordal process extends out of the Hensen's node.<br>
                The prechordal plate migrates ahead of the process.<br>
                Subsequent endoderm cells will spread throughout the trilaminar germ disc to supplant the hypoblast.<br>
                The notochordal process fuses with the endoderm and flattens, to form the notochordal plate.<br>
                The steak will regress after the prechordal plate reaches the oropharyngeal membrane.<br>
                After the prechordal plate reaches this membrane at the cranial end, it expands into the overlying mesoderm.<br>
                The prechordal plate will develop into premandibular condensations, which eventually form extrinsic ocular muscles, and a layer of dura mater separating the cerebellum and occipital lobes known as the cerebellar tentorium.<br>
                The notochordal plate eventually separates from the endoderm to develop into the solid notochord.<br>
                Separation of the plate proceeds from the caudal to cranial end of the germ disc.  Note, this is opposite to the typical direction of early embryogenesis.<br>
                The primitive streak, node, notochordal plate and process, all regress, leaving the solid notochord.<br>

            <b>Caudal End</b><br>
                As the streak regresses the germ disc adopts a curved shape.<br>
                The last cells to invaginate through the regressing primitive streak cluster in a bulge known as the caudal eminence.<br>
                Note, these cells are by definition mesodermal.<br>  
                The caudal eminence develops into the caudal end of the notochord.<br>
                Thus, the caudal end of the notochord is derived from the caudal eminence, not Hensen's node.<br>
                The completed notochord extends from the base of the brain to the tip of the tail.<br>
                Eventually the notochord will degenerate.  The only notochordal tissue that persists at birth forms the nuclei pulposi of intervertebral discs.<br>
                The most important function of the notochord is that it serves as an organizer, secreting morphogens that control development of adjacent tissues.<br>

            <b>Overview </b><br>
                Invagination of epiblast cells through the caudal midline constitutes the primitive streak.<br>  
                Hensen's node, primitive node, & primitive knot, are all synonyms for the bulge at the cranial end of the primitive streak<br>
                Epiblast cells that ingress through the early streak insert into the underlying hypoblast, where they differentiate into endoderm.<br>
                Invasion of the endoderm pushes the hypoblast into the yolk sac, where it becomes known as extraembryonic endoderm.<br>
                The prechordal plate is derived from the first endodermal cells to ingress through the streak.<br>
                Epiblast cells that ingress through the node remain contiguous, forming a hollow tube known as the notochordal process.<br>   
                Epiblast cells that ingress though a primitive ridge dissociate as mesenchymal mesoderm, which spreads between the epiblast and endoderm.<br>  
                The mesoderm consists of both mesenchyme and notochord, everything that ingresses through the streak besides the endoderm.<br>
                The notochordal process quickly fuses with the underlying endoderm, to form the notochordal plate.<br>
                The notochordal plate elongates in the cranial direction.<br>
                The prechordal plate migrates ahead of the notochordal plate.<br>
                As the endoderm proliferates, it eventually supplants the hypoblast by pushing it completely into the extraembryonic endoderm.<br>
                The primitive streak will regress after the notochordal plate reaches the oropharyngeal membrane.
                As the primitive streak regresses, it continues to contribute to the mesenchymal mesoderm and notochordal plate.<br>
                The notochordal process eventually separates from the endoderm to form the solid notochord.<br>
                The notochord will regress. Its most important function is as an organizer, secreting growth factors to control development of adjacent tissues.<br>
                Primitive streak regression is completed by the end of week 4.<br>
                The primary purpose of the primitive streak is to produce the three germ layers.<br>
                Mesoderm produces internal tissues such as muscle, bone, blood, dermis, connective tissue and internal organs<br>
                Endoderm produces epithelia of organs including lungs, liver, pancreas and the digestive track
                Ectoderm produces the nervous system and epidermis<br>
