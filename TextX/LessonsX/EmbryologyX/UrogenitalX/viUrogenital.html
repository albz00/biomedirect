        <p><h3><b>Urogenital Morphogenesis</b></h3><br>
            <b>Mesoderms</b><br>
                A substantial proportion of the urogenital system is derived from the intermediate mesoderm.<br>
                Intermediate mesoderm constitutes two cords that run the length of the embryo (sometimes called nephrogenic cords).<br>
                These columns run parallel to other columns such as the neural tube, gut and embryonic aortae.<br>
                After coelom closure intermediate mesoderm becomes positioned along the dorsal body wall.<br>

            <b>Pronephros</b><br>
                The cranial intermediate mesoderm aggregates into 7 to 10 cell clusters.  Each line of clusters is known as a pronephros.<br>
                Underdeveloped, nonfunctional nephrons form in pronephroi.<br>
                The pronephroi will degenerate and disappear.<br>

            <b>Mesonephros</b><br>
                The mesonephros develops from the central region of the intermediate mesoderm.<br>
                Mesonephric nephrons form in mesonephroi.<br> 
                They first appear at the cranial end of the mesonephros, and progressively more develop in the caudal direction.<br>
                Mesonephric nephrons lack loops of Henle, and they do not concentrate urine.<br>
                Therefore, the mesonephric nephrons do not purify embryonic blood.  The allantois and placenta serve that function.<br>
                The mesonephric and embryonic metanephric nephrons function to cycle fluid through the embryonic body.  The embryo swallows amniotic fluid and urinates it back into the amniotic cavity.<br>  
                Mesonephric ducts form by longitudinal evagination of the surface of the metanephros.<br>
                These ducts will elongate in the cranial to caudal direction.<br>
                Mesonephric ducts eventually connect to the cloaca.<br>
                A genital ridge develops on each the ventral side of each mesonephroi.<br>
                Each will develop into a gonad.<br>
                A urogenital ridge is a mesonephros with a genital ridge.<br>
                Paramesonephric ducts form by evagination of epithelium along the anterolateral surface of the urogenital ridge.<br>
                Paramesonephric ducts run lateral to the mesonephroi, but cross the mesonephric ducts before attaching to the cloaca.<br>
                The funnel shaped cranial ends open to the abdominal cavity.<br>
                Ureteric buds sprout off mesonephric ducts.  These elongate, to form ureters.<br>
                The Mesonephroi will regress, leaving ureters, gonads, and mesonephric ducts.<br>

            <b>Metanephros</b><br>
                Each metanephros develops from the caudal ends of intermediate mesoderm. They will develop into the excretory parts of the kidneys.<br>
                Kidneys are composed of two systems, an excretory and collecting system.  Development of the collecting system will be described first.<br>

            <b>Collecting System</b><br>
                Ureteric buds sprout off mesonephric ducts.<br>  
                These elongate into ureters.<br>
                Each ureter reaches its metanephros.  In the metanephros the ureter bifurcates to form the renal pelvis.<br>
                The ends continue to bifurcate, forming a network of collecting ducts.<br>  
                While the distal continue to bifurcate, the proximal regions of the collecting ducts fuse to form calyxes.<br> 
                The first bifurcation forms the renal pelvis.<br>
                The next four bifurcations fuse to form major calyces.<br>
                The following four bifurcations fuse to form minor calyces.<br>
                Subsequent branching forms one to three million collecting ducts.<br>
                Branches sprout off the collecting ducts.  These are known as ampullae.<br>

            <b>Excretory System, Nephron Development</b><br>
                Differentiating metanephric cells cluster around ampullae to form blastemal caps.<br>
                The cells of the caps aggregate to form hollow spheres known as renal vesicles.<br>
                Vesicles elongate, forming S shaped tubules.<br>
                Distal ends of tubules flare into cup shaped Bowman's capsules.<br>
                Glomeruli develop from capillaries that grow into the capsules, where they branch into a convoluted network.<br>
                Glomeruli with Bowman's capsules constitute Renal Corpuscles.<br>
                Tubules fuse with ampullae to form distal convoluted tubules.  Thus, distal convoluted tubules are composed of metanephric and mesonephric tissue.<br>
                Each tubule elongates and coils into a proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule.<br>
                Everything from glomerulus to distal convoluted tubule constitutes a nephron.<br>
                Plasma is filtered from the blood, through the renal corpuscle.  Solutes and water are reabsorbed by the nephron and collecting duct, and urine is excreted.<br>
            <b>
            <b>Nephron Reabsorption</b><br>
                A major function of nephrons is to reabsorb water.<br>
                The majority of the filtered H2O and solute is reabsorbed isosmotically from the proximal convoluted tubule.<br>
                Sodium and chloride are reabsorbed from the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, to the interstitial space of the outer medulla.<br>
                Not only does this increase the osmolality of the medulla, it also lowers the osmolality within the thick limb.<br>
                Energy for reabsorption is ultimately provided by Sodium Potassium A T P aces.<br>
                In the cortex, water diffuses from descending to ascending limbs.<br>
                This occurs because after passing through the inner medulla, the osmolality of ascending limbs is higher.<br>
                Sodium chloride is transferred to the inner medulla by descending limbs of the vasa recta.<br>
                Consequently, osmolality becomes greater in ascending limbs than descending limbs of vasa recta.<br>
                Because the osmolality of the ascending limbs is higher, Sodium chloride diffuses back to the less concentrated descending limbs.<br>
                The result of Sodium chloride cycling is to retain salt in the inner medulla.<br>
                In the inner medulla ascending vasa recta reabsorb Sodium chloride.  This occurs because the osmolality of the inner medulla is greater than the vasa recta.<br>
                This "short circuit" reduces the amount of water that enters the medulla.<br>
                The short circuit of water and cycling of Sodium chloride by vasa recta constitutes the counter current exchange system.  This system serves to maintain the osmolality of the inner medulla.<br>
                The osmolality of the inner medulla is increased further by reabsorption of urea from the collecting duct.<br>
                Much of this urea reenters the loop of Henle to be recycled back through the collecting duct.<br>  
                Sodium chloride and urea reabsorption raises the osmotic pressure of the medulla.<br>
                This draws water out of the descending thin limb of the loop of Henle.<br>
                It has been proposed that the osmotic pressure of the medulla is further amplified by counter current multiplication.<br>
                Osmosis also draws water out of the collecting duct in the inner medulla.  This is the final step, maximizing the concentration of urine.<br>
                Thus, the filtrate passes through the medulla twice, (first through the loop of Henle, then through the collecting duct), and water is reabsorbed each time.  However, two passes are not what amplifies urine concentration.  If that were all that happens then the filtrate would reach equilibrium with the inner medulla during the first pass, and no reabsorption would occur during the second pass.<br>
                What allows additional reabsorption of water from the collecting duct is reabsorption of Sodium chloride out of the thick ascending limb.  This lowers tubular osmolality, which allows additional water reabsorption to occur when the filtrate reaches the collecting duct.  The result is to amplify the concentration of urine.<br>
                If the body is over hydrated aquaporins are not inserted into the epithelia of the collecting duct in the cortex and outer medulla.<br>
                This decreases reabsorption and increases excretion of water.<br>
                Water reabsorbed in the medulla is returned to the circulatory system through vasa recta.<br>
                Note, in the cortex, reabsorption occurs through peritubular capillaries.<br>
                Sodium chloride is regularly added to the medulla, so to maintain equilibrium the excess is also removed through the vasa recta.<br> 
                The net result is to concentrate urine by reabsorbing water.<br> 

            <b>Counter Current Multiplier</b><br>
                To understand counter current multiplication, a simple model will be explained first, then the principles will be applied to the more complication scenario in the nephron.<br>
                For the simplified mode, consider a permeable tube with a 180 degree bend, so that fluid flows down an inflow branch of the tube, around the bend, and back up the outflow branch.  For counter current multiplication to occur, it is important that the ascending and descending branches be adjacent to each other, side by side.<br>  
                Both branches begin filled with the same concentration of sodium chloride.  For our example we’ll assume that concentration is 300 milli os moles per kilogram H2O, which is the concentration of blood.<br>
                Active transport pumps ions from the outflow to inflow branch.  Assume the pumps will establish a gradient of 200 milli os moles per kilogram.<br>
                As fluid continues to flow through the tube, the lower concentration fluid is pushed out of the outflow branch, higher concentration fluid in the inflow branch is pushed to the bend as more isosmotic fluid flows into the inflow branch.<br>
                Active transport increases the concentration within the inflow branch even further.<br>
                Continued flow and active transport preferentially increases or multiplies the concentrations at the bend of the tube.<br>
                Thus, constant backward pumping, from outflow to inflow, serves to "pool" ions at the bend.<br>
                In actual kidneys the inflow branch is the descending thin limb of the loop of Henle, while the outflow branch is the thick ascending limb.<br>
                The concentration within the thick ascending limb is decreased by pumping out Sodium chloride, however unlike the simplified model, this salt does not enter the descending limb.  Instead it is deposited in the interstitial space of the medulla.<br>
                Increasing the osmolality of the medulla serves to draw water out of the descending thin limb by osmosis.<br> 
                This increases the concentration within the descending limb, which allows more ions to be pumped out when the filtrate reaches the ascending limb, drawing more water out of the descending limb.<br>
                This positive feedback is what multiplies the concentration around the bend of an actual loop of Henle.<br>
                Water and excess Sodium chloride are removed through vasa recta.<br>

            <b>The Kidney</b><br>
                The renal artery branches within the kidney to feed the glomeruli.<br>
                Nephrons form in the renal cortex.<br>
                Columns of nephrons attached to collecting ducts.<br>
                Collecting ducts assemble into renal pyramids.  The nephrons are located between the pyramids.<br>
                Renal papilla anchor pyramids.<br>   
                In the medulla, filtrate flows from the collecting ducts, through the papilla, calyces and the pelvis, into the ureter.<br>
                
            <b>Horseshoe Kidney</b><br>
                A horseshoe kidney forms when both kidneys fuse.<br>
                The merged kidney gets stuck on the inferior mees en teric artery<br>

            <b>Kidney Ascent and Revascularization</b><br>
                Metanephroi form at the caudal end, near the cloaca.<br>
                Initially metanephroi are supplied by arteries attached to the pelvic branch of the aorta.<br> 
                As metanephroi develop into kidneys, they migrate cranially.<br>
                As kidneys ascend they are progressively revascularized.  A succession of aortic branches extend and degenerate.<br>
                Migration ends when kidneys affix to the dorsal wall of the abdominal cavity, juxtaposed to the suprarenal glands.<br>  
                Sometimes the accessory arteries do not all regress.  When this happens, they can obstruct the ureter.<br>
            <b>Reproductive Systems Morphogenesis</b><br>
            <b>Indifferent Stage</b><br>
                In early embryos the reproductive system is indistinguishable between males and females.<br>
                This is the indifferent stage.<br>
                During this period gonads are described as bipotential gonads because they can develop into testes or ovaries.<br>
                Development of the indifferent reproductive system will be described first, then differentiation of the indifferent systems into male and female reproductive systems.  The male system will be described before the female.<br>
            <b>Gonads</b><br>
                Primordial germ cells are the progenitors of the germ line.<br>
                They concentrate in yolk sac endoderm, near the allantois.<br>
                In mice they originate from primitive streak cells that migrate into the yolk sac.<br>
                Amoeboid PGCs migrate from yolk sac, through vitelline duct, gut, dorsal mees en tery, mesonephros, to a genital ridge.<br>
                As the genital ridges develop into gonads, epithelial columns extend inward to form primitive sex cords.<br>  
                The PGCs are deposited into these primitive sex cords.<br>
                PGCs will differentiate into spermatogonia or oogonia.<br>

            <b>The Cloaca</b><br>
                The cloaca is an endodermal structure at the caudal end of the intestine.<br>
                The cloaca splits into the urogenital sinus and anorectal canal when a mesodermal sheet known as the urorectal septum grows between them.<br>
                The anorectal canal will develop into the anus.<br>
                The urogenital sinus is subdivided into the phallic, pelvic and bladder regions.<br>
                The bladder region will develop into the urinary bladder.<br>
                Caudal ends of mesonephric ducts are incorporated into the dorsal wall of the bladder, forming a region known as the trigone.<br> 
                The pelvic region of the urogenital sinus will develop into the prostatic and membranous urethra.<br>
                A paramesonephric tubercle is a bulge on the inside wall of the pelvic region, where the paramesonephric duct contacts the urogenital sinus.<br>  
                The phallic region contributes to the phallus, which is an outward projection at the caudal end of the urogenital sinus.<br>
                The urethral groove is the lumen of the phallic region of the urogenital sinus.<br>
                The urethral plate is the epithelial lining of the groove.<br>

            <b>Genitalia, External</b><br>
                The cloacal membrane first appears caudal to the primitive streak.  It is a region of juxtaposed ectoderm & endoderm.<br>
                When the cloaca forms, the cloacal membrane covers its opening to the amniotic cavity.<br>
                Urethral folds form around the cloacal membrane.  These are elevations of lateral mesoderm.<br> 
                The genital tubercle is a bulge of lateral mesoderm that develops at the cranial junction of the urethral folds.<br>
                Next genital swellings develop lateral to the cloacal folds.  These are also composed of lateral mesoderm<br>
                When the cloaca splits into the urogenital sinus and anorectal canal, the cloacal membrane and folds split into the urethral and anal membrane and folds.<br>
                The urethral and anal membranes then breakdown.<br>
                Degeneration of these membranes opens the phallic region of the urogenital sinus, and the anorectal canal, to the amniotic cavity.<br>
                The urethral groove is the open lumen of the phallic region of the urogenital sinus.<br>
                The epithelial lining of the groove is the urethral plate.<br>
                The caudal end of the urogenital sinus pushes outward to produce the phallus.<br>

            <b>Females</b><br>
            <b>Ovaries</b><br>
                The sex cords degenerate, releasing the PGCs.<br>
                A second set of cords, known as cortical cords, extend from the ovarian epithelium, extend.<br>  
                The cortical cords then dissociate, releasing cord cells.<br>  
                Cord cells surround clusters of PGCs.<br>
                PGCs multiply mitotically and become known as oogonia.<br>
                Oogonia enter meiosis I and become primary oocytes.<br>
                Cord cells surround individual oocytes and become follicular cells.<br>
                A primordial follicle is a primary oocyte with a follicular epithelium.<br>

            <b>Genitalia</b><br>
                Urethral groove is obliterated as it flattens & opens.<br>  
                The urethral plate becomes the vestibule.<br>
                The genital tubercle develops into the clitoris.<br>
                Genital swellings develop into labia majora.<br>
                The urethral fold develops into the labia minora.<br>

            <b>Vagina</b><br>
                At the point of contact between the paramesonephric ducts and cloaca, the tips of the ducts fuse.<br>  
                The zone of fusion is known as the uterovaginal primordium.<br>  
                Fusion of the uterovaginal primordium will extend cranially to form the uterus.<br>  
                The cranial most regions of the paramesonephric ducts do not fuse.  These regions develop into uterine tubes.<br>
                Finger like fimbriae grow from the funnel at the end of a paramesonephric duct, forming an infundibulum.<br>
                The caudal most region of the uterovaginal primordium also extends downward, to develop into the cranial third of the vagina.<br>
                Paramesonephric tubercles are bulges on the inside of the urogenital sinus, where the paramesonephric ducts connect to the sinus.<br>
                The paramesonephric tubercles induce formation of a pair of solid outgrowths of the urogenital sinus, known as sinovaginal bulbs.<br>
                Sinovaginal bulbs fuse to form the solid, vaginal plate.<br>
                The vaginal plate connects to the cranial vagina.<br>
                The vaginal plate translocates down the urethra.<br>
                The vaginal plate develops a lumen and becomes the caudal two thirds of the vagina.<br>
                When the caudal vagina reaches the vestibule, it separates from the urethra.<br>
                The urethra and vagina are left with separate openings in the vestibule.<br>
                The hymen is a membranous sheet that remains across the vaginal opening.  It will develop an opening during the perinatal period.<br>
                Mesonephric ducts degenerate.<br>
                The epoophoron and paroophoron are persistent remnants of mesonephric ducts, which will be are suspended in the mesovarium mees en tery, (not shown) which connects ovaries to uterine tubes.<br>
                An epoophoron can give rise to a paraovarian cyst, which can cause uterine bleeding, painful intercourse, or an adenoma.<br>
                Gartner’s ducts are another remnant of the mesonephric duct.  They can develop into a Gartner’s cysts, which are attached to the lateral wall of the vagina.<br>  
                These are usually asymptomatic, but can produce painful menstruation, vaginal discharge, bladder dysfunction, urinary incontinence and infections.<br>

            <b>Males</b><br>
                Gonads develop into testes under the influence of the SRY gene (sex determining region Y).  The X chromosome lacks the SRY gene so female gonads develop into ovaries.<br>

            <b>Tubing</b><br>
                A layer of connective tissue, known as the tunica albuginea, forms to separate the testicular epithelium from the sex cords.<br>
                Primitive sex cords assemble as horseshoe shaped loops.<br>
                Primitive sex cords develop into testis cords.<br>
                These will develop into seminiferous tubules.<br>
                Rete testis grows from sex cords.<br>
                Epigenital tubules develop from mesonephric nephrons.<br>
                Paragenital tubules are degenerate mesonephric nephrons.<br>
                4 to 6 epigenital tubules develop into the ductuli efferents.<br>
                The caudal mesonephric ducts expand.  The cranial mesonephric ducts (superior to the testis), and paramesonephric ducts degenerate.<br>
                The appendix epididymis is a remnant of cranial mesonephric duct.<br>
                A prostatic utricle is a remnant of the paramesonephric duct attached to the prostatic urethra. It can develop into a cyst, which is usually asymptomatic.<br>
                An appendix testis is a remnant of paramesonephric duct, attached to the tunica vaginalis of a testicle. It can undergo painful torsion.<br>
                A mesonephric duct proximal to a testis coils into the convoluted epididymis.<br> 
                The remaining mesonephric duct becomes the vas deferens.<br> 
                This remains a solid cord until puberty, when a lumen forms by cannulation. 

            <b>Genitalia</b><br>
                The genital tubercle develops into the glans penis.
                Genital swellings develop into the scrotum.
                Extension of the phallus draws the urethral folds together.
                These folds are eventually internalized where they become the penile urethra.
                The raphe is the line of fusion where the folds are internalized.
                A lumen develops within the penile urethra by canalization.
                An epidermal, ectodermal cord known as the penile meatus penetrates the glans.
                This cord will become canalized, and it will connect to the penile urethra.
                The phallus has now developed into the penis.
                Both testes and ovaries migrate caudally, but Testes migrate further, eventually entering the scrotum.

            <b>Testes Descent</b><br>
                Each mesonephros is attached to the dorsal abdominal wall by a urogenital mees en tery.
                As each mesonephros regresses, its urogenital mees en tery develops into a gubernaculum that tethers the testis to the pelvic floor of the abdominal wall.
                Each testis descends because its gubernaculum shortens, drawing it to the base of the abdominal cavity.
                Concurrently each gubernaculum extends through the abdominal wall to the scrotal swellings.
                The vaginal process is an evagination of the peritoneum that follows the course of the gubernaculum.
                An inguinal canal is a passage through the abdominal wall that a testis passes through.
                Each testis is drawn through the abdominal wall, around the symphysis, into the scrotum.
                Each gubernaculum shortens into a short ligament anchoring the testis to the scrotum.
                Each vaginal process develops into a tunica vaginalis that wraps its testis.
                In addition to the scrotum, three layers contribute to the scrotal sac.  Each of these are derived from layers of the abdominal wall.
                The inguinal canal is the passage through the abdominal wall that the testes are drawn through. It was originally defined by the gubernacula.
                The Transversalis Fascia is continuous with the Internal Spermatic Fascia of the scrotum.
                The Internal Abdominal Oblique Muscle is continuous with the Cremasteric Fascia and Muscle of the scrotum.
                The External Abdominal Oblique Muscle is continuous with the External Spermatic Fascia of the scrotum.

            <b>Glands</b><br>
                The seminal vesicle buds from the dorsal side of the mesonephric ducts. 
                The prostrate gland sprouts from the ventral prostatic region of the urogenital sinus, between the bladder and pelvic regions.   
                The bulbourethral gland buds from the dorsal surface of the phallic region of the UG sinus.

            <b>Summary of Urogenital Derivations</b><br>
                The epiblast produces the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm
                The ectoderm produces the cloacal membrane which regresses, the epidermis covering the external genitals, and the penile meatus.
                The Intermediate Mesoderm which is also known as the Nephrogenic Cord, produces the Pronephros, Mesonephros and Metanephros.
                The Pronephros regresses.
                The Metanephros produces the excretory system of the kidneys.
                The Mesonephros produces the Urogenital Ridge, Paramesonephric Duct and Mesonephric Duct.
                The Urogenital Ridge produces the genital ridge, which develops into the testes or ovaries. 
                In females the Paramesonephric Duct develops into uterine tubes, uterus, cervix, and cranial third of the vagina
                In males the Paramesonephric Duct regresses.
                A prostatic utricle is an asymptomatic remnant of the paramesonephric duct attached to the prostatic urethra.
                An appendix testis is a paramesonephric duct remnant attached to a testicle, that can undergo painful torsion 
                The Mesonephric Duct produces the trigone of the urinary bladder, and the ureteric bud.
                The ureteric bud produces the collecting system of the kidney.
                In males the Mesonephric Duct produces the vas deferens, ductuli efferent, epididymis and seminal vesicle.
                In males the cranial end of the Mesonephric duct regresses into a remnant known as the appendix epididymis.
                In females the Mesonephric duct regresses
                An epoophoron and paroophoron are remnants of a mesonephric duct in the mesovarium mees en tery.
                A Gartner's duct is a remnant of a mesonephric duct that can produce a Gartner’s cyst attached to the lateral vagina.  These can produce complications such as painful menstruation.
                The Endoderm produces the cloaca, which divides into the Anorectal Canal and Urogenital Sinus.
                The Anorectal Canal develops into the rectum.
                The bladder region of the urogenital sinus develops into the urinary bladder.
                The sinovaginal bulb buds off of the urinary bladder.
                In females the sinovaginal bulb develops into the caudal two thirds of the vagina.
                The pelvic region of the urogenital sinus develops into the prostatic and membranous urethras.
                In males the prostate and bulbourethral gland sprout off of the prostatic urethra.
                The phallic region of the urogenital sinus produces the urethral plate and urethral groove.
                Lateral mesoderm surrounding the cloacal membrane produces the urethral fold, genital tubercle and genital swelling.
                The genital tubercle develops into the glans penis in males, the clitoris in females.
                The genital swelling develops into the scrotum in males, the labia major in females
                The urethral fold develops into the penile urethra in males, the labia minora in females
                The urethral plate develops into the membranous urethra in males, the vestibule in females
                The urethral groove develops into the lumen of the penile urethra in males. It is obliterated in females.
