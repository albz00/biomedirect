        <p><h3><b>Cytogenetic Defects</b></h3><br>
            <b>Triploidy</b><br>
                69, XXX<br>
                Three Homologs of every Chromosome in the genome<br>
                A Polyploidy<br>
                Etiology Polyspermy<br>
                Three possible fates<br>
                Spontaneous Abortion, Most Common, about 15% of all Cytogenetic Abortions, Often Before Pregnancy Realized<br>
                Partial Hydatidiform Mole, Little Fetal Tissue, Grape Like Villi, Risk for Choriocarcinoma<br>
                Livebirth, Uncommon, Multiple Deformities, example given Microsomia which is a small body, Syndactyly which are Fused Digits and Large Cystic Placenta. <br>
                Regardless of the fate, the mortality is 100% <br>

            <b>Aneuploidies</b><br>
                Aneuploidies are when there is the wrong number of a specific chromosome, either trisomy or monosomy.  These will be listed from the most to least common. <br>
                Triple X syndrome, genotype Trisomy X, XXX, incidence one in 500. <br>
                Extra Y syndrome, genotype XYY, incidence one in 500<br>
                Klinefelter’s syndrome, genotype XXY, incidence one in 500<br>
                Down’s syndrome, genotype trisomy 21, Incidence one in 800<br>
                Turner’s syndrome, genotype X monosomy, Incidence one in 4000<br>
                Edwards syndrome, genotype trisomy 18, Incidence one in 8000<br>
                Patau’s syndrome, genotype trisomy 13, Incidence one in 12000<br>
                Contrary to common belief the frequency of Down’s is the most frequent, although it is comparable to the extra sex chromosomes. <br>
                All chromosomes are believed to undergo nondisjunction at the same frequency.  <br>
                The incidence of aneuploidies at birth is determined by spontaneous abortion rates. <br>

            <b>Down’s</b><br>
                Trisomy 21 (47, XY, +21) <br>
                Origins of Down’s Syndrome<br>
                Trisomy 21, 94%, from Meiotic Nondisjunction<br>
                Mosaics, 3%, from Early Mitotic Nondisjunction<br>
                Partial Trisomy, 3%, from Translocations<br>
                The defect is inherited from the mother 80% to 95% of the time. <br>

            <b>Critical Region</b><br>
                Partial trisomies demonstrated that patients with three copies of band 21q22 will have Down’s syndrome. <br>
                Three copies of other regions of chromosome 21 do not result in Down’s. <br>
                Thus, q22 is the critical region for Down’s syndrome. <br>

            <b>Symptoms</b><br>
                Intellectual Disability, moderate (IQ 30 to 50) <br>

                Short broad hands (64%)<br>
                Incurved 5th finger (57%)<br>
                Short 5th finger (58%)<br>
                Down’s patients have a distinctive appearance. <br>
                Single crease across palm. <br>
                These are a normal variant of wild type people, but they are much more common in Down’s patients. <br>

                Alzheimer like dementia with over expression of β amyloid<br>

            <b>Screens</b><br>
                Screening for Down’s in Pregnancy<br>
                Quad Screen, Maternal Serum with the following results is indicative of Down’s syndrome<br>
                Low alpha fetoprotein, high human chorionic gonadotropin, Low Estriol, high Inhibin<br>
                Fetal Nuchal Translucency Measurements<br>
                Absence of Fetal Nasal Bone<br>
                Amniocentesis, Cytogenetic Analysis, recommended Maternal Age, 35 years or older<br>
                Why 35? <br>
                After 35 year old the chance of detecting a cytogenetic defect exceeded the risk of miscarriage due to amniocentesis. <br>
                There is not a marked increase in risk of aneuploidy at maternal age 35; that is just a point on a continuously increasing curve. <br>
                35 years is simply the point where the risk of having a child with an aneuploidy exceeded the risk of miscarriage induced by amniocentesis. <br>
                Therefore, it is inappropriate to tell a patient that her risk will increase when she reaches 35 years; her risk is already increasing before she reaches that age. <br>
                The 35 year old criteria presume a judgmental value that many will not share; i.e. having a child with an aneuploidy is worse than losing a potentially healthy pregnancy. <br>
                Many parents have fulfilling relationships with their aneuploidy children, even if those children have severe symptoms, and many aneuploid patients live happy, enriching lives. <br>
                Therefore, for many parents, having a child with an aneuploidy may not be worse than losing a pregnancy. <br>
                Moreover, these criteria are outdated because the risk of miscarriage induced by amniocentesis has decreased due to improvements with the technology. <br>
                Due to considerations like these, genetic counseling should always be non directive.  Counselors should provide parents and/or patients (if the patients are old enough) with all relevant information without interjecting their own values, and let those parents and/or patients make decisions that are right for them.<br>

            <b>Edwards</b><br>
                Trisomy 18 (47, XX, +18) <br>
                Unlike Down’s, there is no critical region for Edwards. <br>
                Different partial trisomies along the length of chromosome 18 all produced symptoms of Edwards.<br>

            <b>Symptoms</b><br>
                Clenched Fists, Overlapping Fingers (2nd over 3rd, 5th over 4th) <br>
                Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) <br>
                Severe Intellectual Disability, no Psychosocial Development<br>
                Early Death, usually under one year old<br>
                Prominent Occiput <br>
                Micrognathia which is a small jaw<br>
                Posteriorly Rotated, Fawn Like Ears<br>
                Sloping Forehead<br>
                Microcephaly<br>
                Narrow Hips<br>
                Small Nails<br>
                Fingerpads with simple, Low Arch Patterns <br>
                Cardiac, genital and urinary deformities<br>
                The most distinguishing malformation of Edwards is the overlapping digits. <br>
                If this is observed the patient should be considered Edwards until proven otherwise. <br>
                Because of the lack of psychosocial development, the child will not be able to focus on or even recognize people. <br>
                It is important to prepare parents for the eventuality of little interaction with their child. <br>
                Narrow Hips <br>
                Small Nails<br>
                The clinched fists and overlapping digits occur because Edwards patients cannot open their hands.<br>
                Fawnlike ears are a common congenital defect.  They occur because during embryogenesis ears fail to completely move from the posterior to lateral sides of the head. <br>
                Other common congenital defects include cleft lips and palate, clubbed and rocker bottom feet, microcephaly and microsomia, syndactyly and clinodactyly.  These are not diagnostic for any specific syndrome, but they are suggestive of cytogenetic or teratogenic defects. <br>

            <b>Mortality</b><br>
                Postnatal mortality is extremely high with Edwards, as is prenatal mortality.  <br>
                Most Edwards newborns die within a week.  However, a few can survive for years.  The oldest known patient survived for over 34 years. <br>  
                It is important to prepare parents for the probability of a brief period of time to spend with their Edwards child, as well as the hope for extended life with all the joy and hardship that will entail.<br>
                The incidence of females with Edwards is higher than males. This is because mortality is higher with males. <br>
                Growth rates are lower than normal with Edwards.  Those few who survive to adulthood seldom reach more than 50 lbs. <br>

            <b>Patau’s Syndrome</b><br>
                Trisomy 13 (47, XY, +13) <br>

            <b>Symptoms</b><br>
                Patau’s is generally more serious than Edwards. <br>
                Midline defects are the hallmark of Patau’s. <br>
                Holoprosencephaly, cleft lip/palate, hypotelorism to cyclopia<br>
                Prominent Proboscis<br>
                Severe Intellectual Disability, no psychosocial development<br>
                Short Life Expectancy, seldom beyond 1 year, Patau’s mortality is even higher than Edwards. <br>
                Intrauterine Growth Restriction<br>
                Microcephaly<br>
                Microphthalmia (small eyes) <br>
                Scalp Defects<br>
                Polydactyly<br>
                Clinodactyly, Abnormal Bending of Digits<br>
                Rocker Bottom Feet<br>
                Renal & Cardiac Deformities<br>
                Omphalocele, Herniation into the Umbilical Cord<br>

            <b>Turner’s Syndrome</b><br>
                45, X<br>
                X monosomy<br>

            <b>Symptoms</b><br>
                Webbed Neck<br>
                Shield Chest (broad) <br>
                Cubitus Valgus, Increased Carrying Angle (in explanation out turned forearm) <br>
                Prepubertal Ovarian Failure<br>
                Streak Gonads<br>
                Delayed Puberty, Primary Amenorrhea<br>
                Little to no Breast Development<br>
                Down Slanting Palpebral Fissures<br>
                Female<br>
                Normal IQ, Possibly Impaired Spatial Thinking<br>
                Short Stature<br>
                Prominent Low Set Ears<br>
                Low Posterior Hairline<br>
                Fetal Cystic Hygroma<br>
                Lymphedema<br>
                Congenital Heart Disease (20%), Aorta Coarctation Most Common<br>
                Renal Malformations (38%)<br>
                Nondisjunction Usually Paternal<br>
                Cystic hygroma produced by lymphedema is a major factor contributing to the prenatal mortality of Turner’s syndrome. <br>
                It has been suggested that cystic hygromas may contribute to the webbed neck observed with Turner’s syndrome. <br>

            <b>Klinefelter’s Syndrome</b><br>
                47, XXY<br>

            <b>Symptoms</b><br>
                Slightly Decreased IQ<br>
                Physically Normal in Early Childhood<br>
                Maternal and Paternal Inheritance Equal<br>
                Clinical Findings After Puberty<br>
                Microorchidism, small testicles <br>
                Gynecomastia (15% to 30%), Breast Development<br>
                Feminized Body Habitus<br>
                Infertility (95%)<br>
                Tall Stature<br>
                Elongated Digits<br>
                Klinefelter’s is underdiagnosed due to late onset of relatively mild symptoms. <br>
                The hallmark of Klinefelter’s is feminization. <br>
                The majority (70% to 85%) of patients with Klinefelter’s do not have gynecomastia.  Moreover, many teenage boys develop gynecomastia even though they do not have Klinefelter’s.  Therefore, although there is an increased incidence of gynecomastia with Klinefelter’s, it is not pathognomonic.<br>
                Small testicles are the most distinguishing symptom of Klinefelter’s. <br>

            <b>Extra Sex Chromosomes</b><br>
                The extra sex chromosome syndromes, XYY and XXX, have minor symptoms. <br>
                47, XYY <br>
                Little or No Symptoms<br>
                Tendency to Tall Stature<br>
                No Increase in Aggression<br>
                Increased Incidence of ADHD<br>
                47, XXX<br>
                Little or No Symptoms<br>
                Tendency to Tall Stature<br>
                Possible Endocrine or Fertility Problems<br>

            <b>Sex Determining Region of Y</b><br>
                The SRY gene is the critical region for male development.  If an individual has this region he develops as a male.  Without it she develops as a female. <br>
                Note, most XX males are phenotypically normal, while most XY females have Turner’s to like phenotypes. <br>

            <b>Chromosomal Aberrations</b><br>
                Remember a chromosomal aberration is a structural mutation within a chromosome, deletion, duplication, insertion, inversion, translocation. <br>
                A very rare example is chromosome 3 duplication deletion syndrome, a very rare cytogenetic disorder resulting from an inversion within chromosome 3. <br>

            <b>Cri du chat Syndrome</b><br>  46, XN, del(5)(p15) <br>
                Symptoms<br>
                Cat Like Cry<br>
                Severe Intellectual Disability<br>
                Microcephaly<br>

                Flat Nasal Bridge<br>
                Epicanthal Folds<br>
                Down Slanting Palpebral Fissures<br>
                Hypertelorism<br>
                Single Palmar Crease<br>
                Hypotonia<br>
                Older Patients<br>
                Less Pronounced Cry<br>
                Elongated Face<br>
                Language Delay<br>
                Cri du chat results from a deletion of band 1, sub band 5, near the end of the short arm of chromosome 5. <br>
                With fluorescent in situ hybridization, FISH, karyotypes from patients with cri du chat incubated with the 5p(15) probe will only one fluorescent chromosomal homolog.  This confirms the cri du chat diagnosis. <br>

                Prader Willi , Maternally Inherited<br>
                Due to parental specific epigenetics, these are different disorders caused by the same microdeletion (see Clinical Inheritance Patterns lesson). <br>

            <b>Williams Syndrome</b><br> 46, XN, del(7)(q11.2) microdeletion<br>

                This is the most mutable region of the human genome. <br>
                It’s also known as Velocardiofacial, Conotruncal Anomaly Face, or CATCH22 Syndrome. <br>
