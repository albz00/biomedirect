        <p><h3><b>Mendelian Genetics</b></h3><br>
            <b>Mendel</b><br>
                Gregor Mendel reported the laws of genetics to the Burns Society of Natural History in 1865.<br>

            <b>Genetic Terminology</b><br>
                Genetics, Analysis of inheritance patterns to identify and characterize genes.<br>
                Note this is not simply the study of genes.  If genes are studied at the molecular level (DNA or RNA) it is referred to as molecular biology, not genetics.<br>
                Genes, Biological factors that control traits.<br>
                Alleles, Alternate forms of a given gene, inherited from different parents.<br>
                Locus, The location on a chromosome, often used to refer to the gene at that site.<br>
                The blue eye color gene occurs at a specific site on a specific chromosome.  This is the blue eye locus.  We inherit two homologs of this chromosome, one from each parent, so we have two copies of the eye color locus.  Each copy of this gene is a different allele.<br>
                Dominant, An allele which always determines the phenotype.  This is denoted with a capital letter.<br>
                Recessive, An allele which only determines phenotype in the absence of a dominant allele. This is denoted with a lower case letter.<br>
                If someone inherits two dominant alleles (BB) they have brown eyes. If they inherit a dominant and a recessive allele (Bb), they still have brown eyes. If they inherit two recessive alleles (bb), they have blue eyes.<br>
                Mutant, A mutated allele, or individual with a mutated allele.<br>
                Wild Type, An allele, or individual, that is not mutated, as it normally occurs in nature.<br>
                This nomenclature came from early genetic work, where fruit flies were mutated in the laboratory.<br>  Non mutant flies were like those found in the wild, and so they were called wild type.<br>
                Note, mutant alleles are typically recessive, but they can display any inheritance pattern; dominance, semidominance, etc.<br>
                Genotype, The combination of alleles in an individual.   example given the genotype for Brown and blue eye alleles is capital B, lower case b.  For simplicity, these will be referred to as big B and little b.<br>
                Phenotype, The physical manifestation of the genotype.  Observable characteristics.  example given the phenotype of an individual who has one dominant eye color allele, and one recessive, is brown eyes.<br>  
                Homozygous, to have both copies of the same allele i.e. both dominant or both recessive, two capital Bs or two lower case bs<br>
                Heterozygous, to have different alleles i.e. one dominant one recessive <br>
                Homozygote, a homozygous individual<br>
                Heterozygote, a heterozygous individual<br>
                Hemizygote, a male who carries an X linked allele<br>
                Hemizygosity is explained further in the Sexual Genetics lesson.<br>
                A brown eye person with two dominant eye color alleles, and a blue eye person with two recessive eye color alleles, are both homozygotes for the eye color locus.<br>
                A brown eye person with a recessive allele, is a heterozygote.<br>
                Monohybrid Cross, a cross where one gene locus is tracked.   example given big A, little a with big A, little a<br>
                Dihybrid Cross, a cross where two loci are tracked.   example given big A, little a, big B, little b, with big A, little a, big B, little b<br>
                Trihybrid Cross, a cross where three loci are tracked.   example given big A, little a, big B, little b, big C, little c with big A, little a, big B, little b, big C, little c<br>
                F 1 (filial one), the first generation produced in a series of crosses<br>
                F 2 (filial two), the second generation produced in a series of crosses<br>
                Independent Assortment, allelic Inheritance at one locus is not affected by another locus<br>
                This is the fundamental principle of genetics.<br>

            <b>Abbreviation</b><br>
                Two recessive examples will be used to illustrate how genes are designated.  The first will be the blue eye locus. The second will be a disorder known as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS).<br>  
                EDS is sometimes called the rubber man syndrome. It is characterized by loose skin and joints.  Understanding EDS is not an objective of this lesson.  It is merely provided as a clinically relevant example.<br>
                There are dominant and recessive types of EDS.  The dominant types are actually more common, but a recessive type will be designated for the following examples.<br>
                Loci are named after the mutant allele.<br>  
                Dominant alleles are capitalization or designated by a plus symbol, lower case indicates recessive.<br>
                Thus, capital B does not stand for brown; it's for dominant at the blue eye locus.  Capital E designates wild type, lower case e is  Ehlers Danlos syndrome.<br>  
                In the literature genes are designated with three letters, however for simplicity one letter will be employed for this lesson.<br>

            <b>Monohybrid Cross</b><br>
                To understand why crosses produce predictable proportions of progeny with specific genotypes and phenotypes, lets follow a monohybrid cross.<br>
                All the gametes from a homozygous brown eye parent will possess dominant alleles because that's all that parent has.  Gametes from the blue eye parent will all possess recessive alleles.<br>
                All the F1 progeny must be heterozygous because they have to inherit a dominant allele from the brown parent, and a recessive allele from the other parent.  That's all those parents have to give.<br>
                Half the gametes of each F1 will possess dominant alleles, half will possess recessive alleles.<br>
                If two heterozygotes mate, there is one way to produce homozygous dominant, two ways to produce heterozygotes, and one way to produce homozygous recessive progeny.<br>
                Thus, 1/4 of the offspring will be homozygous dominant, 1/2 will be heterozygous, 1/4 homozygous recessive.<br>
                Note, these are the genotypes.<br>  
                For phenotypes, 3/4 of the offspring will have brown eyes, 1/4 will have blue eyes.<br>

            <b>Dihybrid Cross</b><br>
                If one parent who is homozygous dominant for two loci, mates with another individual who homozygous recessive for both loci, then all the F1 must be heterozygous for both loci because they have to inherit dominant alleles from the first parent, recessive alleles from the second parent (that's all those parents have to give).<br>
                For the gametes of heterozygotes at two loci, 1/4 will be dominant at both loci, 1/4 will be dominant B, recessive e, 1/4 will be recessive b, dominant E, 1/4 will be recessive for both loci.<br>
                There are 16 different ways these gametes can combine.<br>
                Counting like genotypes produces the ratio, 1 to 2 to 1 to 2 to 4 to 2 to 1 to 2 to 1. For instance, there is only one way to produce progeny that are homozygous dominant for both loci, big B, big B, big E, big E, two ways to produce heterozygotes for b and homozygous dominant for e, big B little b, big E big E, and four ways to produce heterozygotes for both loci, big B, little b, big E little e.<br>
                Adding like phenotypes produces the ratio, 9 to 3 to 3 to 1.<br>

            <b>Punnet Square</b><br>
                A Punnett square is another way to determine ratios.<br>  
                Write all the possible allelic combinations from one parent along the top.  With the cross traced above this would be big B, big E, then big B, little e, then little b big E, then little b, little e.<br>
                Then write all the possible allelic combinations from one parent along the side.  These would be the same.<br>
                Next fill in the matrix.<br>
                Add all the like genotypes in the matrix.  This will give you the 1 to 2 to 1 to 2 to 4 to 2 to 1 to 2 to 1 ratio of the dihybrid, heterozygous cross.<br> 
                Punnett squares are cumbersome, error prone tools for working out genetic problems.<br>
                The best way to work out genetic problems is to memorize and utilize the basic ratios.<br>

            <b>Test Cross</b><br>
                There is one other basic ratio to define.  This is known as a test cross.<br>
                A test cross is a monohybrid cross between a parent with a dominant phenotype, and a recessive parent.<br>
                If the dominant parent is homozygous, then all the F1 will have brown eyes.<br> 
                If the dominant parent is heterozygous, then half the F1 will have brown eyes, half will have blue eyes.<br>
                This is why it's called a test cross.  It can be used to determine the genotype of an individual with a dominant phenotype.<br>
                Note, for the purpose of this lesson it is not important to understand how a test cross is used to determine the genotype of a dominant individual.  This was explained so you will understand why it is called a test cross. What you need to know is that the ratio of a cross between a heterozygote and recessive homozygote is 1 to 1.<br>

            <b>Ratios</b><br>
                We are now able to define the four basic genetic ratios.<br>  
                These are 1 to 1, which is the phenotypic and genotypic ratio produced by a cross between a heterozygote and homozygous recessive parent.<br>
                3 to 1, which is the phenotypic ratio produced by a cross between two heterozygote.<br>
                1 to 2 to 1, which is the genotypic ratio produced by a cross between two heterozygote and 9 to 3 to 3 to 1, which is the phenotypic ratio produced by a cross between two heterozygote.<br>
                If you memorize these four ratios, and learn how to multiply them together, you’ll be able to work out Mendelian genetic problems much more easily and quickly than you could with Punnet squares.<br>
            <b>Multiplying Ratios</b><br>
            <b>Multiplying Ratios  Dihybrid Ratio</b><br>
                Rules for Multiplying Ratios<br>
                Write the multihybrid cross, for example big B little b, big E little e with big B little b, big E little e.  This is a double heterozygous cross.<br>
                Segregate the multihybrid cross into individual monohybrid crosses by writing each side by side.<br>
                For the eye color locus this would read big B little b with big B little b.<br>
                For the EDS locus this would read big E little e with big E little e.<br>
                Write the monohybrid ratios beneath each monohybrid cross, along with the designations for the genotypes or phenotypes of each class of the ratios <br>
                For phenotypes with the eye color locus this would read 3 big B to 1 little b.<br>
                For EDS this would read 3 big E to 1 little e.<br>
                Multiply each class of the first monohybrid ratio by each class of the second monohybrid ratio, keeping track of the genotypes or phenotypes as you go.<br>
                Begin with the big B class.<br>  
                Multiply 3 big B by 3 big E.  The product is 9 big B, big E.<br> 
                Multiply 3 big B by 1 little e.  The product is 3 big B little e.<br> 
                We’ve now multiplied the big B class by both EDS classes.<br>
                Next multiply the little b class by both EDS classes.<br>
                1 little b times 3 big E equals 3 little b big E.<br>
                1 little b times 1 little e equals 1 little b, little e.<br> 
                Thus, the ratio is 9 to 3 to 3 to 1, big B, big E, to big B little e, to 3 little b big E, to 1 little b, little e.<br>
                This is the phenotypic dihybrid ratio, which is one of the basic ratios you are advised to commit to memory, so you should become able to list it without calculating the monohybrid ratios.  However, this example demonstrated the process for multiplying ratios.<br>

            <b>Using Ratios</b><br>
                When you work out a problem, begin by determining if a question asks for phenotypes or genotypes.<br>
                If it calls for genotypes, work with genotypic ratios.<br>     
                If it calls for phenotypes, work with phenotypic ratios.<br>
                Do not write genotypic ratios and reduce them to phenotypic ratios.<br>
                For instance, if a question calls for phenotypes, do not write out 1 big B big B to 2 big B little b to 1 little b little b, then add 1 big B big B plus 2 big B little b to get 3 big B for the 3 big B to 1 little b phenotypic ratio.  Just write 3 big B to 1 little b in the first place.<br>
                Now let’s work out some examples.<br>

            <b>Question 1, Monohybrid, Phenotypic Cross</b><br>
                Question 1. A brown eye woman and brown eye man has a blue eye child. What is the chance that their second child will have brown eyes? <br>
                This question asks for a phenotype, i.e. brown eyes, so it calls for a phenotypic ratio.<br>
                It only asks about one locus, i.e. the blue eye locus, so it calls for the monohybrid cross.<br>
                Both parents have brown eyes, which indicates that they are either homozygotes (BB) or heterozygotes (Bb).<br> The first child has blue eyes, so that child must have inherited a recessive (b) allele from each parent.<br>  
                Therefore, each parent must carry the b allele, and they both must be heterozygous.<br>
                In summary, this is a monohybrid, heterozygous cross, which is written big B little b with big B little b.<br>
                The monohybrid, phenotypic ratio for this cross is 3 to 1.<br>   
                The class of this ratio that designates brown eyes is the 3.<br>   
                The sum of both classes of the ratio is  3 + 1  =  4.<br>   
                Therefore, the chance that any child will have brown eyes is 3 divided by 4, or 75%.<br>

            <b>Question 2, Monohybrid, Genotypic Cross</b><br>
                What is the chance that another child will be heterozygous? <br>
                This question asks for a genotype, i.e. heterozygotes, so it calls for the genotypic cross, big B little b with big B little b.<br>
                The monohybrid genotypic ratio is   1 big B big B, to 2 big B little b, to 1 little b little b.<br>
                The number in the class that designates heterozygotes, big B little b, is the 2.<br>
                The sum of all the classes is 1 plus 2 plus 1 equals 4.<br>
                Therefore, the chance that any child will be a heterozygous is 2 divided by 4 equal to one half.<br>

            <b>Question 3, Dihybrid, Genotypic Cross</b><br>
                A brown eye woman and brown eye man has a blue eye child.  Both parents have a father with  Ehlers Danlos syndrome, EDS.  What is the genotypic, dihybrid ratio? <br>
                What is the genotypic, dihybrid ratio? <br>
                This question is asks for a genotypic ratio, so when you segregate the monohybrid crosses, write their genotypic ratios.<br>
                For the eye color locus, 1 big B big B, to 2 big B little b, to 1 little b little b.<br> 
                Times the EDS ratio, 1 big E big E, to 2 big E little e, to 1 little e little e.<br>
                Multiply the first eye color class, 1 big B big B, times the first E class, 1 big E big E.<br>
                This equal 1 big B big B, big E big E.<br>
                Next, 1 big B big B, times 2 big E little e, equals 2 big B big B, big E little e.<br>
                Then 1 big B big B, times 1 little e little e, equals 1 big B big B.<br> 
                Now we’ve multiplied the homozygous dominant eye color class by all the EDS classes.  The next step is to multiply all the heterozygous eye color classes by every EDS classes.<br>
                2 big B little b, times the 1 big E big E, equals 2 big B little b, big E big E.<br>
                2 big B little b, times 2 big E little e, equals 4 big B little b, big E little e.<br>
                2 big B little b, times 1 little e little e, equals 2 big B little b, little e little e.<br>
                1 little b little b, times the 1 big E big E, equals 1 little b little b, big E big E.<br>
                1 little b little b, times 2 big E little e, equals 2 little b little b, big E little e.<br>
                1 little b little b, times 1 little e little e, equals 1 little b little b, little e little e.<br>
                The final ratio, obtained by putting everything together, is 1 to 2 to 1 to 2 to 4 to 2 to 1 to 2 to 1<br>
                1 big B big B big E big E, <br>
                to 2 big B big B big E little e, <br> 
                to 1 big B big B big little e little e, <br> 
                to 2 big B little b big E big E, <br> 
                to 4 big B little b big E little e, <br>
                to 2 big B big little b little e little e, <br>
                to 1 little b little b big E big E, <br>
                to 2 little b little b big E little e, <br>
                to little b little b little e little e, <br>

            <b>Question 4, Dihybrid, Phenotypic, Test Cross</b><br>
                A man who is heterozygous the blue eye and EDS loci, marries a woman who is afflicted with EDS.<br>  
                What is the chance that their child will not have blue eyes or EDS? <br>
                This problem will require computation of a dihybrid ratio that won't be memorized.  Therefore, the ratio will need to be computed from simpler monohybrid ratios that should be memorized.<br>
                We were told the father is heterozygous for the EDS locus. The mother is afflicted, so she must be homozygous recessive for EDS.<br>  
                Remember when the question asks for phenotypes, so compute phenotypic ratios.<br>
                The cross is big B little b big E little e with big B little b little e little e.<br>
                The monohybrid cross for eye color is big B little b with big B little b.<br>
                The monohybrid cross for EDS is big E little e with little e little e.<br>
                Note the E locus is a test cross, which is  governed by the 1 to 1 ratio.<br>
                The monohybrid, phenotypic ratio, for eye color is 3 big B to 1 little b.<br>
                For EDS, it’s 1 big E to 1 little e.<br>
                Multiplying these ratios gives a 3 to 3 to 1 to 1 ratio<br>
                3 big B big E to <br>
                3 big B little e to <br>
                1 little b big E to <br>
                1 little b little e<br>
                The original question asked for the percentage of offspring who won’t have blue eyes or EDS.<br>  
                These are the big B big E progeny.<br>
                The number for that class is 3.<br>  
                The calculation is 3 divided by the total, which is 3 plus 3 plus 1 plus 1, equal to 8.<br>
                Therefore, the answer is 3 eighths.<br>
                The probability that the couple will have a child with both dominant phenotypes is 37.5%.<br>

            <b>Complementation Test</b><br>
                A final application of Mendelian genetics is a complementation test.<br>  
                This is used to determine if mutants with the same phenotype are in the same gene, or different genes.<br>
                Complementation can best be explained by example.<br>  
                Consider thalassemia alpha and beta.<br>  
                Both have the same basic phenotype, anemia.<br> 
                Thalassemia alpha results from loss of function of alpha hemoglobin alleles.<br>
                Thalassemia beta results from loss of function of beta hemoglobin alleles.<br>
                Question, a husband and wife both have thalassemia.  They want to know if their child will have thalassemia.<br>
                To answer their question, you must determine if  both parents have the same type of thalassemia,  each alpha or each with beta, or if they have different types, one with alpha the other beta.<br>
                If both parents have thalassemia because they are homozygous mutant for alpha hemoglobin
                then their children would have to be homozygous recessive, because mutant alpha globin alleles are all they could inherit from their parents.<br>
                Thus, if both parents suffer from the same type of thalassemia then all their will suffer from the disorder.<br>
                Now consider the case where each parent has a different type of thalassemia.<br>
                One parent is homozygous mutant for alpha globin, and homozygous wild type for beta globin.<br>
                The other parent is the opposite, homozygous wild type for alpha globin, homozygous mutant for beta globin.<br>
                Their children will all be heterozygous for both genes.<br>  
                This is because they have to inherit a mutant alpha globin allele from the first parent, and a wild type allele from the other parent.<br>  
                For the beta globin locus, they must inherit a wild type allele from the first parent, and a mutant allele from the other parent.<br>
                Thus, if the parents have different forms of thalassemia then their children will not suffer from the disorder.<br>
                The disorders are said to complement each other.<br>
                If two mutations complement each other, they are in different genes.<br>
                Complementary genes are different genes.<br>
