        <p><h3><b>Non-Mendelian Genetics</b></h3><br>
            <b>Non Mendelian Inheritance</b><br>
                This lesson introduces the concept of non Mendelian inheritance by presenting a few examples.<br> Additional examples are described in greater detail with the Clinical Inheritance Patterns lesson.<br> 
                Non Mendelian Inheritance, genetic interactions other than the classic autosomal recessive pattern<br>
                Mendel demonstrated autosomal recessive inheritance, but this is only a fraction of all the patterns that occur.<br>   

            <b>Examples of Non Mendelian Inheritance patterns</b><br>
            <b>Semidominance</b><br>
                Semidominance, alleles exerting equal effects on phenotype,  resulting in intermediate heterozygous phenotypes.<br> 
                Neither allele is dominant.  The phenotype of heterozygotes is a blend between the phenotypes of the homozygotes.<br> 
                Example 1, horse colors<br>
                Genotype big C big C, phenotype chestnut, which are brown<br>
                Genotype big C big C cr, phenotype palomino, beige<br>
                Genotype big C cr big C cr, phenotype, cremello, white<br>
                Palomino is an intermediate blending of chestnut and cremello. <br>
                Example 2, Snapdragon flowers<br>
                Genotype, ww, Phenotype white<br>
                Genotype, rw, phenotype pink<br>
                Genotype, rr, phenotype red<br>
                Pink is an intermediate blending of white and red.<br> 
                Note, the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of semidominant traits are both 1 to 2 to 1.<br> 
                Genotypic ratio, 1 ww to 2 rw to 1 rr<br>
                Phenotypic ratio, 1 white to 2 pink to 1 red<br>
                This is because there are no homozygous dominants that look like the heterozygotes.  Each genotypic class has its own phenotype.<br> 

            <b>Codominance</b><br>
                Codominance, different alleles inducing independent effects on the phenotype<br>
                The phenotype of heterozygotes is not determined by either allele, nor is it a blending of both alleles.  The phenotype of both alleles is observed in the same individual.<br> 
                Example given, A B blood types<br>
                Genotype I A I A, Phenotype, Type A blood<br>
                Genotype I A I B, Phenotype, Type A B blood<br>
                Genotype I B I B, Phenotype, Type B blood<br>
                Type A individuals must be transfused with type A blood.  They reject type B.<br> 
                Type B individuals must be transfused with type B blood.  They reject type A.<br> 
                Type A B individuals can be transfused with either type A or type B blood.  They aren’t type A or B; they’re both.<br>  
                As with semidominant traits, the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of codominant traits are both 1 to 2 to 1<br>
                Genotypic ratio, 1 I A I A to 2 I A I B to 1 I B I B<br>
                Phenotypic ratio, 1 type A to 2 type A B to 1 type B<br>

            <b>Polymorphism</b><br>
                Polymorphism, two or more alleles for a given gene in the population<br>
                An example is eye color.  We have blue, brown, green, grey and other alleles in our population, as well as different shades of each.<br> 
                Note, the depiction of blue eyes in the Mendelian Genetics lesson was a simplification.  There are actually multiple alleles at multiple loci specifying the numerous eye colors observed in humans, not just brown and blue.  Moreover, there are numerous shades of blue.  However, true blue is recessive to colored eyes, whether those are brown, green, black or whatever.<br> 
                Another example is blood types.  There's a third allele in our population, little i.<br> 
                Genotype big I A little i, phenotype, Type A blood<br>
                Genotype big I B little i, phenotype, Type B blood<br>
                Genotype little i little i, phenotype, Type O blood<br>
                Type O can be transfused into type A or B patients.  It won’t be rejected by either. <br>
                Although big I A and big I B are semidominant to each other, i is recessive to both.<br> 
                Thus, there are three alleles at the A B O locus, so the locus is polymorphic.<br> 

            <b>Polygenic Traits</b><br>
                Polygenic Inheritance, multiple genes contributing to a phenotype<br>
                An example is height.  There isn't just one gene that determines our height.  Numerous loci contribute to this trait. <br>

            <b>Epistasis</b><br>
                Epistasis, for a gene to mask the phenotype of another gene<br>
                A gene that masks another gene is an epistatic gene, also known as a suppressor<br>
                For instance, if W W Z Z homozygotes show the Z phenotype, not the W phenotype, then Z suppresses W.<br> 
                Epistasis is used as a research tool for determining the order of genes in a regulatory pathway.<br>
