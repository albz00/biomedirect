        <p><h3><b>Pedigree Analysis</b></h3><br> 
            <b>Introduction</b><br>
            <b>Pedigree </b><br>
                A Pedigree is a Diagrammatic Representation of a Family History<br> 
                The name is derived from the French phrase, pied du grue, which means crane's foot.<br>
                Standard Assumptions
                Assume a trait is autosomal recessive unless told otherwise, or given evidence to the contrary.<br>
                Assume individuals are unaffected if their phenotype is not defined.<br>
                Assume q represents the mutant allelic frequency, unless told otherwise, or given evidence to the contrary.<br>
                Assume the genotypes for all unaffected individuals are homozygous wild type, unless told otherwise, given evidence to the contrary, or if they must be heterozygous for their offspring to be affected.<br>

            <b>Pedigree Chart</b><br>
                Male, Empty Square Symbol<br>
                Female, Empty Circle Symbol<br>
                Unspecified Sex, Empty four sided diamond<br>
                Homozygotes, Solid symbol, square, circle or diamond<br>
                Heterozygous Carriers, half filled symbol.<br>
                 X Linked Recessive Carrier, symbol circle half filled with smaller, solid circle<br>
                By convention hemizygous males are depicted by solid squares because they are affected.<br>
                However, when working out problems empty squares half filled with a solid square or circle can make it easier to visualize that the male only has one allele.<br>
                Proband, index case, family member first identified with a disorder<br>
                The symbol for the proband is marked by a diagonal arrow pointing to it.<br>
                Marriage, horizontal line between spouses, typically male and female, square and circle <br>
                Consanguineous Mating, double lines between two symbols<br>
                Extramarital Mating, dotted line between two symbols<br>
                The symbols that are used most often are male, female, unspecified sex, homozygotes, heterozygotes,  X Linked carriers, marriages and consanguineous matings.<br>  
                Pedigree Construction<br>
                Matings are designated by a horizontal line between parents.<br>  
                A vertical line leads down to the offspring.<br>  
                If there are more than one offspring, the vertical line leads down to a horizontal line, with vertical lines leading down from the horizontal line to each offspring. <br> 
                Pedigree Numbering<br>
                Generations are designated by Roman numerals on the left.<br>
                Individuals within a generation are designated by Arabic numbers, numbered from left to right.<br>
                For instance, if the first mother at the top is placed to the left of the first father, she is designated capital I 1.  The father is capital I 2.<br>
                If they have 5 grandchildren, the fourth offspring from the left would be designated capital I I I 4.<br>

            <b>Characteristics of Inheritance Patterns</b><br>
                Properties will be listed that can be used to identify the inheritance pattern demonstrated by a pedigree.<br>

            <b>Autosomal Recessive</b><br>
                1.) Skips generations<br>
                2.) Multiple siblings affected, (horizontal transmission) <br>
                3.) Both parents must be heterozygous carriers<br>
                4.) One fourth of carrier offspring affected, two thirds of unaffected offspring will be carriers<br>
                5.) Inbreeding increases the risk that an offspring will be affected. <br>
                The most diagnostic properties for recognizing an autosomal recessive trait are skipping generations and horizontal transmission. <br>

            <b>Autosomal Dominant</b><br>
                1.) Affected offspring from one generation to the next generation (vertical transmission) <br>
                2.) All carriers affected<br>
                3.) 1/2 of heterozygotes' offspring are affected<br>
                4.) Only one parent needs to have the mutant allele<br>
                5.) Homozygotes are rare<br>
                6.) Sporadic cases due to de novo mutations<br>
                The most diagnostic property for autosomal dominance is vertical transmission.<br>
                This is because offspring only have to inherit one allele to be affected, so generations are not skipped with unaffected carriers.<br>

            <b>X Linked Recessive</b><br>
                1.) More males affected than females<br>
                2.) Transmission from affected fathers, through carrier daughters, to affected grandsons<br>
                3.) No father to son transmission<br>
                4.) Daughters of affected males always carriers<br>
                5.) Hemizygous males always affected<br>
                6.) Carrier females pass mutated allele to half their offspring, the sons will be affected, the daughters will be carriers<br>
                7.) de novo mutations detectable in males<br>
                8.) No affected males if hemizygous lethal, no affected females If homozygous lethal<br>
                The most diagnostic properties for an  X Linked recessive trait are properties 2, 3 and 4 <br>
                Property 1, more affected males than females, is the first tip to make you suspect X Linkage, but it does not confirm it.<br>  
                Property 2, father to daughter to grandson is the  X Linked pattern, and it constitutes strong evidence for X Linkage.<br>
                Property 3, no father to son transmission, and property 4, daughters of affected fathers always inherit the mutation, can be used to rule out X Linkage, even if 2 seems to occur.<br>  
                If there’s even one case of father to son transmission, then it cannot be X Linkage.<br>

            <b>X Linked Dominant</b><br>
                1.) Vertical Transmission<br>
                2.) No father to son transmission<br>
                3.) All daughters of affected fathers are affected<br>
                4.) Twice as many females affected as males<br>
                5.) Half of the offspring of affected mothers will be affected, regardless of their sex.<br>
                The most diagnostic properties for an  X Linked recessive trait are 1, 2 and 3.<br>
                Property 1, vertical transmission demonstrates dominance.<br>  
                Property 2, no father to son transmission, and 3, transmission from affected fathers to all daughters, confirms X Linkage.<br>

            <b>Mitochondrial</b><br>
                1.) Maternal inheritance, from mothers to all children, regardless of sex, never from fathers to any of their children.<br>
                2.) Severity varies due to altering populations of mutant & wild type mitochondria.<br>
                The most diagnostic property for a mitochondrial inheritance is maternal inheritance.<br>

            <b>Multifactorial Inheritance</b><br>
                1.) Familial recurrence, no distinctive inheritance pattern<br>
                2.) Risk declines sharply from 1st to 2nd degree relatives, less rapidly for more remote relatives. <br>
                3.) The more closely related an affected relative, the greater the risk that a newborn will be affected<br>
                4.) Greater risk with increased familial frequency<br>
                5.) Greater risk with increased severity of affected relatives<br>
                6.) Markedly greater risk if the frequency is less for one sex, and a family already had a child of that sex with the trait.<br>
                The most diagnostic properties for multifactorial inheritance are 1 and 2 <br>
                Most of these characteristics result from dilution of multiple genes from generation to generation.<br>

            <b>Practice, Pattern Recognition</b><br>
                A pedigree has no Father to Son Inheritance<br>
                The disease is transmitted from an affected Father to Carrier Daughter to Affected Grandson.<br>
                There are more affected males than females<br>
                What’s the inheritance pattern? <br>
                 X Linked Recessive<br>
                For this son to be affected, the matriarch must have been a carrier.<br>

                A pedigree shows affected patients skipping generations<br>
                About as many affected males as females<br>
                There is an instance of the disease passing from an affected father to a carrier son to an affected grandson.<br>  
                What inheritance pattern is shown here? <br>
                Autosomal Recessive<br>

                Vertical Transmission is observed with another pedigree<br>
                There are two instances of unaffected daughters from affected fathers<br>
                What pattern do we have here? <br>
                Autosomal Dominant<br>

                A pedigree has no Clear Inheritance Pattern<br>
                The number of Affected Descendants Decreases Through the Generations<br>
                What pattern do we have here? <br>
                Multifactorial<br>

                For the next pedigree all of the children of affected Mothers are affected.<br>
                None of the children of affected fathers are affected.<br>
                How about this; what’s the pattern? <br>
                Mitochondrial<br>

                The final pedigree demonstrates Vertical Transmission<br>
                None of the sons of affected Fathers are affected<br>
                All of the daughters of affected fathers are affected<br>
                What now? <br>
                 X Linked Dominant<br>

            <b>Determining an Offspring’s Risk</b><br>
                A newly wed woman is concerned about her "family's curse," a genetic disorder that her paternal grandmother and brother have.<br>
                No one in her husband’s family has ever had the disease?  The incidence of the disease is 1 in 365.<br>
                How can you determine the risk that she will have a child with the disease? <br>
                The disease is autosomal recessive.  It has skipped a generation and it passed from her father to her brother.<br>

            <b>Risk that the Parent with a Family history is a carrier, two thirds</b><br>
                For her child to be affected three things must happen.  The first is that she must be a carrier.  What is the chance of that? <br>
                Her brother is affected, but not her parents. Therefore, both parents must be heterozygotes.<br>
                At birth her chance was one half.  That is derived from the 1 to 2 to 1 ratio, where the two is the chance that she was a carrier.<br>
                However, she’s now an adult.  If she was homozygous mutant for the disease it would have manifested by now.  Therefore, the last class of the 1 to 2 to 1 ratio can be eliminated, leaving a two thirds chance that she’s a carrier.<br>

            <b>Risk that the Parent with No Family History, 2 pq</b><br>
                The second thing that must happen for child to be affected is that the father must be a carrier, but there's no history of the defect in his family.  How can the chance that he's a carrier be determined? <br>
                With no family history the chance that the father is heterozygous is the same as anyone in the population. This is the Hardy Weinberg carrier frequency, 2pq.<br>
                We were given the incidence of the disease, 1 in 365.<br>
                So q squared equals 1 in 365, which is equal to 0.27%<br>
                q is equal to the square root of 0.27% , which is equal to 5.23%<br>
                p equals 1 minus 0.523, which is equal to 94.8%<br>
                Finally, 2pq equals 2 times 0.053 times 0.94, which equals 9.92%<br>

            <b>Risk that the Offspring will Inherit a mutant Allele from both Parents, if Both Parents are carriers (one fourth) </b><br>
                The third and last thing that must happen for the child to be affected is that he or she must inherit a mutant allele from both parents.<br>  
                If both parents are heterozygous, then the ratio of their cross is 1 to 2 to 1.  Thus, the chance that their offspring will be homozygous is one fourth.<br>

            <b>Final Calculation, Risk that the Offspring will be affected (two thirds times 2 pq times one fourth) </b><br>
                According to the Product Law of probability the chance of multiple events occurring simultaneously is the product of their independent chances.  Therefore, to determine the chance that the child will be affected, multiply the chance of all three things that had to happen.<br>
                The final calculation is 2/3 times 0.0992 times one fourth equal to 0.0165<br>
                Thus, the risk that this couple with have an affected child will only be 1.65%, despite the mother’s family history.<br>  
                This is much greater than if neither parent had a family history, but is still very low.<br>
                Note, this problem was a prototypical pedigree problem.  The chance that one parent is a carrier is two thirds, the chance for the other is 2 pq, and the chance that the child will be homozygous if both parents are carriers is one fourth.  If you understand how to solve a problem like this, it will serve as a basis for working out more advanced problems.<br>

            <b>Inbreeding</b><br>
                Inbreeding, for consanguineous individuals to produce progeny.<br>
                This is a formal way to say two people mate who are related to each other? <br>
                The definition of Consanguineous is for two people to be descended from a common ancestor, usually in recent history.<br>
                Relatives are Consanguineous<br>
                Note, most of us can find a common ancestor if we look far enough back in our family histories.  You would not say two people are consanguineous unless the common ancestor is recent, a few generations back.<br>
                Coefficient of Relationship (R), the fraction of identical genes, shared by two relatives, inherited from their common ancestor.<br>
                To understand R, consider cousins at a family reunion discussing how many genes they share.  What they are talking about is R.<br>  
                Coefficient of Inbreeding (F), the fraction of an offspring's loci that become homozygous due to consanguineous mating.  This is also the chance that any given loci in an offspring will become homozygous due to inbreeding between his or her parents.<br>
                If two relatives mate their offspring can inherit both copies of any allele that they inherited from their common ancestor.  F is the chance of that happening.<br>  
                This is the problem with inbreeding; there is an increased chance that a deleterious allele will become homozygous in the offspring.<br>  
                Also, the number of loci that become homozygous will be greater than normal, which generally decreases the health and strength of the offspring.  This is known as hybrid vigor.<br>
                Monozygotic Twins, develop from the same zygote. R = 100%<br>
                Dizygotic Twins, simultaneously develop from different zygotes. R = 50%<br>
                This is the basis for conducting twin studies.  We know exactly how many alleles they share, so they allow us to estimate how much of a trait is determined by genetics, and how much is environmental.<br>

            <b>Coefficient of Relationship (R) </b><br>
                Let's consider this consanguineous mating.  How can we determine R, F, and the chance that a specific allele from the common ancestors will become homozygous? <br>
                The formula for R is one half to the n <br>
                n is the number of matings in the inbreeding loop<br>
                The logic for this is that each time there's a mating the number of common alleles is reduced in half.<br>
                So how do we recognize the "inbreeding loop?" <br>
                Start with one of the inbreeding parents.  Then count each mating leading to the other parent.<br>
                Consider a pedigree with a married couple who have common ancestors.<br>
                There are two generations between the wife and the common ancestors.  In other words, the ancestors are her grandparents.<br>
                There are three generations between the husband and the common ancestors.  These ancestors are his great grandparents.<br>
                The first mating in the loop between the couple is the wife’s parents.<br>
                The second mating is between the common ancestors.<br>  
                We’ve now traced the branch of the loop from the wife to the common ancestors.<br>  
                Next, we need to trace down the branch loop between the common ancestors to the husband.<br>  
                The third matting is between the husband’s grandparents.<br>
                The fourth, and last mating is between the husband’s parents.<br>
                Thus, there are four matings in the inbreeding loop.<br>
                So, R is one half to the fourth, which is 1 sixteenth.<br>  
                The wife and husband share on in sixteen genes, inherited from their common ancestors.<br>

            <b>Coefficient of Inbreeding (F) </b><br>
                F is the number of the common ancestors’ genes that will become homozygous in the couple’s children.<br>
                To understand how to compute F, understand that there is an additional mating in the inbreeding loop, the couple’s mating.<br>  
                Half of the alleles that the inbreeding parents inherited from their common ancestors become homozygous in their offspring, so F is R divided by 2.<br>
                F equals R divide by 2, equals 1 in sixteen divided by two, equals 1 in 32.<br>
                Why do half of the alleles become homozygous, why not more or less, or even all.  Understand, that for every allele the parents inherited from their common ancestor, there's another allele that they inherited from their other ancestors.  Therefore, for each locus there's a 50% chance that their child will inherit the common ancestor's allele, and on the average they will inherit half of the common ancestor's alleles from each parents.<br>

            <b>Inheriting a Common Ancestor’s Disease</b><br>
                Chance for a Particular Allele<br>
                What if we know that a common ancestor carried a mutant allele? <br>
                How do we determine the chance that the offspring will become homozygous for that allele? <br>
                The answer is to determine the last heterozygote and count the number of descendant leading to the child, down the maternal and paternal lines.<br>
                The logic is there is a 50% chance that a heterozygote will pass the mutant allele onto the offspring.<br>
                This count is to be designated n.<br>
                The risk (P) can then be computed with the formula, P equals one half to the n.<br> 
                As an example, let's say that for the couple above, the wife’s grandfather, who is the husband’s great grandfather, had a parent with cystic fibrosis (cf).<br>
                This person, the wife’s grandfather, will be designated capital I I 1.<br>
                We know the capital I I 1 must be heterozygous because he had to inherit a cf allele from his father, and he isn't affected.  Remember that if you are not told that an individual is affected then assume he or she isn't.<br>
                Because capital I I 1 is the last person in the inbreeding loop known to carry the cf allele, he is where you begin counting.<br>
                His daughter is the first descendant leading down the maternal line to the child. There is a 50% chance that this daughter will inherit capital I I 1’s cf allele.<br>
                The wife is the second descendant leading to the child.<br>
                The child is the third descendant.  The child must be included in the count, because there’s a 50% chance that the child will inherit the cf allele from the wife.<br>
                There are four descendants down the paternal line.<br>  
                These are capital I I 1’s son, this son’s daughter, the husband, and the child.<br>
                Remember to count the child a second time because he must receive the allele from both lines to be homozygous affected.<br>
                Thus, n equals 3 plus 4, which is equal to 7<br>
                P equals one half to the seventh, which is 1 in 128<br>
                That is the final answer.  A genetic councilor can reassure this couple that the risk that their child will suffer from cf is very low, only 0.78%.<br>
