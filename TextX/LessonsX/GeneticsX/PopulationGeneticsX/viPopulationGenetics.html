        <p><h3><b>Population Genetics</b></h3><br>
            <b>Derivation of Hardy Weinberg Equations</b><br>
                Mathematic principles for characterizing genetic distribution and inheritance throughout populations were formulated in 1908 by G. H. Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg.<br>
                Derivation of these equations begins by defining two parameters, the frequencies  of a gene's dominant and recessive alleles throughout a population.<br>
                f big A, frequency of Dominant Allele<br>
                f little a, frequency of recessive allele<br>
                Hardy and Weinberg defined f big A as p.<br>
                This is the proportion of dominant alleles in the population.<br>
                f little a is q.<br>
                This is the proportion of recessive alleles in the population.<br>
                If there are only two alleles for a gene, then the fraction of one plus the fraction of the other, must constitute them all, 100%.<br>
                Therefore, p plus q equals 1.<br>
                Because 1 times 1 equals 1, then p plus q, times p plus q, must equal 1.<br>
                p plus q, times p plus q is the same as p plus q squared<br>
                The product of p plus q squared, is p squared plus 2 times p times q, plus q squared.<br>
                This is a basic binomial expansion, the algebraic formula taught in high school.<br>
                X plus Y squared  equals X squared, plus 2 times X times Y, plus Y square.<br>
                Indeed, the 1 to 2 to 1 ratio for a monohybrid cross is actually a binomial expansion.<br> 
                Big B little b crossed with big B little b, produces the 1 big B big B, to 2 big B little b, to 1 little b to 1 little b ratio<br>
                This is an example of scientific beauty, biology governed by mathematics.<br>

            <b>Summary </b><br>
                To summarize, the Hardy Weinberg equations and parameters are as follows.<br>
                Hardy Weinberg Equations <br>
                p squared, plus 2 times p times q, plus q squared, equals 1<br>
                p plus q equals 1<br>
                Allelic Frequencies<br>
                p is the frequency of the Dominant Allele in the population<br>
                q is the frequency of the recessive allele in the population<br>
                Genotypic Frequencies<br>
                p squared is the frequency of dominant homozygotes in the population<br>
                2 pq is the frequency of heterozygotes in the population<br>
                This is knowns as the carrier frequency<br>
                q squared is the frequency of recessive homozygotes in the population<br>
                This is known as the incidence, which is the frequency of affected individuals<br>
                It is important to avoid confusing these parameters.  For instance, if you're given an allelic frequency, this is q not q squared.<br>
                Carriers are the heterozygotes who carry the recessive allele but don’t express it.<br>
                Affected refers to individuals who are afflicted with a genetic disorder.<br>
                Patients are referred to as affected because it would be insensitive to call them mutants.<br>

            <b>Assumption for Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium</b><br>
                The Primary Assumption is that gene frequencies are constant; the population is at steady state.<br>
                The formal definition of evolution is for the frequency of one or more alleles to change.<br>  
                Therefore, another way to state the primary assumption is that a population is not evolving.<br> 
                Secondary Assumption, None of the following phenomenon are occurring.  If any are the primary assumption is not valid.<br>
                In reality the following phenomenon are always occurring, but their rates are typically low enough for Hardy Weinberg calculations to provide close approximations.<br>
                Mutation, change in an allele's base pair sequence<br>
                A mutation only adds one new allele to a population, so its effect on gene frequency and evolution is very minor.  The most important influence of mutation is to contribute new alleles to a population. The other phenomenon, particularly selection, determine if the frequency of that allele increases in subsequent generations. <br>
                Genetic Drift, Changes in allelic frequencies due to random chance.  Either the mortality of individuals with an allele, or inheritance of an allele, happens to be higher or lower than predicted.<br>  
                This has a significant effect on small populations; where random variation can have a substantial influence.<br> 
                The affect diminishes drastically with increasing population size.<br>
                Migration, exposure of two populations to each other due to emigration, resulting in combined population frequencies<br>
                Due to advances in transportation our populations have become subject to increased migration.  Therefore, it is likely that gene frequencies will change over time.<br>
                Selection, preferentially passing alleles to future generations due to increased fitness<br>
                Fitness is the ability to pass genes onto offspring.<br>
                If an allele decreases the ability to evade predators, then fewer individuals with the allele will survive long enough to breed and pass their genes onto offspring.<br>  
                Therefore, the fitness of individuals with this allele is decreased.<br>
                However, if another allele decreases fertility, then individuals with that allele can survive as long as individuals without the allele, but the fitness of individuals with the allele will be decreased because they will produce fewer offspring and fewer of their genes will be passed onto future generations.<br>
                Therefore, fitness is not only about survival; it is influenced by any factor that affects genes onto future generations.<br>
                Selection is driven by fitness; genetic drift results from random variation from generation to generation.<br>
                Natural selection has the greatest impact on changes in gene frequency and evolution.<br>

            <b>Sample Population Genetics Problem</b><br>
                A 20 year old man proposes marriage to his 18 year old girlfriend.  The young woman says yes, but she's concerned because she has cystic fibrosis (CF).  She wants to know the risk that they will have a child who's afflicted with her disease.  The young man does not have CF, nor does anyone in his family.  The incidence of CF is 1 in 2500.  What is the risk that they will have a child with CF? <br>
                The woman has CF so she must be homozygous recessive, little cf little cf.<br>
                This means that any child she has will inherit one of her mutant cf alleles.<br>
                The man does not have CF so he cannot be homozygous recessive.  Does that mean there's no risk that their child will be afflicted? <br>
                No, CF is recessive.  Therefore, he could be heterozygous, + little cf, in which case he would carry a mutant allele without having the disease.<br>  
                If he had any relatives with CF, we could deduce the chance that he inherited that relative's mutant allele.  For instance, if he had a grandparent with the disease, the chance would be one half.  However, there's no CF in his family.<br>
                The answer is we have to use Hardy Weinberg genetics.  The chance that he's a heterozygote is the population's carrier frequency, 2 pq.<br>
                We were told that the incidence, q squared, is 1 in 2500, which is equal to 0.04%.<br>
                So, does 2 pq equal 0.96% (1 minus 0.4%)?<br>
                No, if 1 = p squared plus 2 times p times q plus q squared, then 1 minus q squared equals p squared 2 pq.<br>  
                This is not the carrier frequency, 2 pq, it is the carrier frequency plus the homozygous dominant frequency, 2 pq plus p squared.  We need 2 pq without p squared.<br>
                So how do we get from incidence to carrier frequency, 2 pq? <br>
                The answer is algebra, using the Hardy Weinberg equations.<br>
                q squared equals 1/2500, equals 0.0004<br>
                q equals the square root of q squared.<br>  
                The square root of 0.0004 is 0.02, which is 2%.<br>
                If p plus q equals 1, then 1 minus q equals p.<br>
                So, p equals 1 minus 0.02, equals 98%.<br>
                2 pq equals 2 times 0.02 times 0.98, which is equal to 0.0392<br>
                Thus, with p & q, we can compute the chance that the man carries the cf allele, 2 pq is equal to 3.92%.<br> 
                So, is this our answer; is this the risk that their child will have CF? <br>
                The answer is no. This is because there's one other thing that must happen for the child to be affected.<br>
                Even if the father is heterozygous, the son would still have to inherit his mutant allele. The chance of that is one half.<br>
                Thus, the risk that a child produced by this couple will have cystic fibrosis is 1 half times 2 pq, which is 0.5 times 0.0392, which equals 1.96%.<br>
                That's our answer. The risk that the child will have cystic fibrosis is just under two percent.<br>

            <b>X Linked Recessive Frequencies</b><br>
                q squared is the frequency of individuals with two mutant alleles, but for  X Linked traits males only need one mutant allele to be affected, so their incidence is just q, the chance of inheriting the one allele.<br>
                Incidence for  X Linked traits in females is still q squared, because they have to inherit two mutant alleles to be affected.<br>
                Male Incidence is q<br>
                Female Incidence is q squared<br>

            <b>Sample Population Genetic Problem with an  X Linked Recessive trait</b><br>
                Mr. Johnson's father was red green color blind.  There is no history of color blindness in his wife's family.  The incidence of color blindness is 8% in men.  What is the risk that they will have a son with red green color blindness? <br>
                Red green color blindness is  X Linked recessive.  The mutant allele is designated X rg.<br>
                Concern about color blindness may have been raised by the condition of Mr. Johnson's father, but that’s actually not relevant.  As an  X Linked trait, red green color blindness cannot pass from father to son.  Therefore, Mr. Johnson could not have inherited the X rg allele from his father, and even if he did there's no way his son could inherit it from him.<br>
                The only way the son could be color blind is if he inherited the allele from his mother.  For that to happen she would have to be a carrier.  So how do we determine the chance that she is heterozygous for the X rg allele? <br>
                We were told that the incidence in men is 8%.<br>  
                If the trait was autosomal then incidence would be q squared, but this trait is  X Linked, so the incidence in men is the same as the allelic frequency, q.<br>
                p equals 1 minus q equals 92%<br>
                2 pq equals 2 times 0.08 times 0.92 equals 14.7%<br>
                This is the chance that the mother is a carrier.  However, even if she's a carrier their son would still have to inherit her mutant allele.  The odds of that are one half.<br>
                Thus, the risk that their son will be red green color blind is 0.147 divided by 2 equals 7.36%.<br>
                In other words, the chance that he inherits an X rg allele carried by his mother is 7.36 out of 100.<br>
                What if we were given the same problem with the incidence in women (0.64%), instead of incidence in men (8%).<br>  
                The incidence of an  X Linked recessive trait in women is q squared, just as with autosomal traits.<br>  
                As explained previously this is because women must have two mutant alleles, X rg X rg, to be affected.  Therefore, the problem needs to be worked out the same, except that the calculations have to begin with q squared.<br>
                q squared equals 0.64%<br>
                q equals square root of 0.0064 equals 8%<br>
                This is the value for q given above, so work the rest of the problem out as outlined previously.  The final risk will compute to 7.36%, as before. <br>
