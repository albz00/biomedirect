        <p><h3><b>Sexual Genetics</b></h3><br>
            <b>Glossary</b><br>
                Sex Determining Chromosomes, X and Y<br>
                Autosome, any chromosome except X or Y<br>
                 X Linked, a gene located on the X chromosome<br>
                Note,  X Linked genes are often referred to as "sex X Linked."  However, this is imprecise because there are a few genes on the Y chromosome, which also qualify as sex X Linked.<br>
                Autosomal, any gene not located on X or Y, or characteristic not associated with X or Y<br>
                Hemizygote, a male with half as many  X Linked alleles<br>
                There are few genes on the Y chromosome.  So, males only have one allele for most X linked genes. This is half the number in females, and half the number for autosomal genes, hence the prefix hemi, which means half.<br>
                Sex Influenced Expression, autosomal traits, differentially expressed in the sexes example given body hair and aggression<br>

            <b>X Linkage</b><br>
                As an example, we’ll consider the inheritance of red green color blindness, which is  X Linked.<br>
                The mutant allele is designated X rg.<br>  
                Wild type alleles are designated X plus.<br>  
                This designation reminds us that the rg allele is on the X chromosome.<br>
                We begin by mating a homozygous wild type female with a Color Blind Male.<br>
                The cross is written X plus X plus with X rg Y.<br>
                All F1 daughters are unaffected carriers, X plus X rg.<br>
                None of the F1 sons inherit the mutation because they received the Y chromosome, which lacks the gene.<br>
                One half of the F2 grandsons will be affected, X rg Y, the other half do not inherit the mutation, X plus Y.<br> 
                None of the F2 granddaughters will be affected.<br>
                One half will be unaffected carriers, X plus X rg, the other half will not inherit the mutation, X plus X plus.<br>
                The distinguishing characteristic of X linkage is inheritance from affected grandfather, through unaffected carrier mother, to affected son.<br>

            <b>X Inactivation</b><br>
                The Y chromosome has very few genes, the X chromosome has many.<br>
                Males have one X chromosome, females have two, so females have twice as many  X Linked alleles as males.<br>
                This type of dosage imbalance cannot be tolerated in animals.<br>  
                An example of this is Down syndrome, trisomy 21, which have three copies of every gene on chromosome 21 instead of the normal two.<br>
                To compensate, mammal females inactivate one or the other X in every cell of their bodies.<br>
                X inactivation occurs during early embryogenesis.<br>  
                By the blastocyst stage one or the other X chromosome is inactivated in every blastomere.<br>

            <b>Barr Bodies</b><br>
                X chromosomes are inactivated when they condense into heterochromatic masses known as Barr bodies.  These can be observed by light microscopy.<br>
                The blastomeres proliferate into clusters of daughter cells.  The same X chromosome is inactivated in all the cells of a cluster because they are all derived from the same blastomere.<br>
                In the ectoderm, these clusters develop into patches of skin, where the same X chromosome is inactivated in all the cells of a patch.<br>
                Thus, mammalian females are genetic mosaics, with a mixture of cells with one or the other inactivated X chromosome.<br>
                X inactivation is also called lyonization, after Mary Lyon who discovered it.<br>

            <b>Calico Cats</b><br>
                Mosaic X inactivation can be observed with calico cats, where the orange hair grows from patches of epidermis with one inactivated X chromosome, the dark hair grows from epidermis with the other inactivated X.<br>

            <b>Mosaic Ladies</b><br>
                Mosaic X inactivation was demonstrated in human females who were heterozygous for the  X Linked disorder, anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (A E D).<br> 
                One symptom of this disease is diminished sweat gland secretion, which lowers dermal electroconductivity.<br> 
                Patches of epidermis with different electroconductivity was observed in heterozygous women.<br>
                All the cells of patches with low electroconductivity expressed the mutant A E D allele.  The wild type allele was inactivated in these cells. Cells with high electroconductivity expressed the wild type allele and inactivated the mutant allele.<br>
